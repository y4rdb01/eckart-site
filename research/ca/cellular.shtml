	<strong>Dr. J Dana Eckart</strong>:
	The <em>Cellular</em> Automata Simulation System
</p>

<p>
The system consists of a compiler for the <em>Cellang</em> cellular automata
programming language, along with the corresponding documentation, viewer,
and various tools.  <em>Cellang</em> has been undergoing refinement for the 
last several years, with corresponding upgrades to the compiler.
PDF versions of the <a href="tutorial.pdf">tutorial</a> and 
<a href="cellang.pdf">language reference manual</a>
are available for those wanting more detailed information. A variety of
<a href="examples/life/index.shtml">example</a> programs is also available.
The most important distinguishing features of <em>Cellang</em>, include support 
for:
<ul>
	<li> named constants, including constant arrays with values read in
		from a file;

	<li> any number of dimensions;

	<li> compile time specification of each dimension's size;

	<li> cell neighborhoods of any size (though bounded at compile time) 
		and shape;

	<li> positional and time dependent neighborhoods;

	<li> associating multiple values (fields), including arrays, with 
		each cell;

	<li> associating a potentially unbounded number of mobile agents
		[ Agents are mobile entities based on a mechanism of the same 
		  name in the Creatures system, developed by Ian Stephenson 
		  (ian@ohm.york.ac.uk).] with each cell; and

	<li> local interactions only, since it is impossible to construct 
		automata that contain any global control or references to 
		global variables.  

</ul>
In addition, the compiler supports the integration of filter
programs.  This ability means that you can write routines that massage
the output created by the automata, and because they are compiled in,
run much faster than by having to use separate programs and standard I/O
(i.e., pipes) to do the same thing.
</p>

<p>
The currently release also supports 3D viewing using OpenGL.
Although at the present, viewing anything with more than several thousands
active cells is somewhat slow, as processors become faster
and hardware support for the 3D graphics more pervasive this will continue
to improve.
</p>

<p>
Both a
<a href="cellular.unix.tar.gz">U<font size=-2>NIX</font></a>
and a <a href="cellular.wintel.tar.gz">Windows</a>
version of the system are available.  Please note that Windows users will
need to
use the <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</a> command to unpack the
Windows version of the system.
An older version of the system is available for the Apple Macintosh.
My special thanks to <a href="mailto:a_kowald@chemie.fu-berlin.de">Axel
Kowald</a> for updating his <a href="cell4mac.sit.hqx">Apple
Macintosh</a> port of the system.
I am grateful for his work and willingness to make it available to others.
</p>

<p>
The U<font size=-2>NIX</font> version 
supports the X11, Iris Graphics Library, and OpenGL windowing
systems and can generate shared memory multi-threaded code for multi-processor
<a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a> and 
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/">SGI</a> machines.
Both the U<font size=-2>NIX</font> and Windows versions also support the
use of
<a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~library/TechReports/1994/ut-cs-94-247.ps.Z">
microvectors</a>, which can greatly (by a factor of 5 or more) increase the 
speed at which some cellular automata execute.
</p>

<p>
The distribution is about 20 MB unpacked.  Nearly all of the size is a GNU
C compiler and various utilities for the Windows installation.  These
items are also present in the U<font size=-2>NIX</font> distribution (though
they aren't used).  They are in the <tt>wintel</tt> subdirectory and can be
safely removed (after installation in the Windows case) in order to save
space.
</p>

<p>
A small, but growing, set of <a href="examples/life/index.shtml">examples</a>
should help to illustrate the capabilities of the system.  Many are
straightforward implementations of well known automata.  If you decide to use
the <em>Cellular</em> system, any contributions that you would be willing to
make to the examples page would be greatly appreciated.  Contributions should
be addressed to the author of this page.
</p>

<p>
From May 1993 through May 1997, this work was jointly supported by
<a href="http://www.runet.edu/">Radford University</a> and
<a href="http://www.usra.edu/">USRA</a> as part of a NASA/JOVE grant.
During June and July of 1997, the work was supported by a grant from
<a href="http://www.fuji-ric.co.jp/">Fuji Research Institute Corporation</a>.
The 3D viewing capability was added in the Summer of 1998 as part of a
research grant from the <a href="http://www.arl.mil/">US Army Research Lab</a>.
The ability to perform computations in floating-point was added in the
Summer of 1999, also as part of a
research grant from the <a href="http://www.arl.mil/">US Army Research Lab</a>.
