<ol>
<li> Terminology
	<ol>
	<li> A <em>Vulnerability</em> is a software bug that can be used to
		subvert the security of a system.
	<li> An <em>exploit</em> is a particular set of actions taken against
		a vulnerability to gain access to information or capabilities
		that would otherwise be unavailable.
	<li> <em>Security</em> refers to overall problem of ensuring that
		only authorized persons are allowed access to the data and
		capabilities of a system.
	<li> <em>Protection mechanisms</em> refers to the specific OS mechanisms
		used to provide security.
	<li> A <em>hacker</em> is someone who enjoys the creativity and
		challenge in solving problems (often working around the
		limitations of existing tools). With respect to computing,
		these tools may be existing APIs, system architectures,
		and system designs.
	<li> A <em>cracker</em> is someone who attempts to gain unauthorized
		access to data or systems. Within computing, this is a
		generalization of the term "safe cracker".
	</ol>
<li> Threats
	<ol>
	<li> Passive (read only) vs active (read/write) intruders.
	<li> Confidentiality - explicitly determines who can see/do what.
		<ol>
		<li> Issues of privacy also play an important role in security.
			Many people object to widespread:
			<ol>
			<li> Surveillance by the NSA,
			<li> Data collection by credit card companies, and
			<li> Tracking of web browser use across a wide range of
				activities.
			</ol>
		<li> Passive intruders may not even need electronic "access"
			to the machine:
			<ol>
			<li> Pick up and deocde the elctro-magnetic patterns
				produced by the machine.
			<li> Use accelerometers in tablets and phones to
				determine what's being clicked/typed.
			<li> Use of sound and reflections to determine (at
				a distance) what's being clicked/typed.
			</ol>
		<li> Recent breaches in data are reminders about how much
			information (e.g., contact, financial, medical)
			are available on-line:
			<ol>
			<li> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/01/10/target-data-breach-spilled-info-on-as-many-as-70-million-customers/">Target</a>
			<li> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularosenblum/2014/09/19/home-depot-data-breach-banks-response-is-critical-to-consumer-reaction/">The Home Depot</a>
			<li> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-02/jpmorgan-says-data-breach-affected-76-million-households.html">JP Morgan Chase</a>
			<li> <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/11/11/usps_data_breach_chinese_hackers_suspected_of_targeting_u_s_postal_service.html">USPS</a>
			</ol>
		</ol>
	<li> Integrity - unauthorized persons cannot remove or change data.
	<li> Availability - unauthorized persons are not able to make a system
		unusable or reduce its performance.
		<ol>
		<li> (Distributed) Denial-of-Service attacks
		<li> Protecting against data loss (usually dealt with via
			backups).  Check out the
			<a href="http://www.taobackup.com/">Tao
			of Backups</a>.
		</ol>
	<li> Implicit in the above threats is the ability to correctly
		determine the identity of persons, and whether or not they
		are authorized. Conflicts between the need for identification,
		desires for personal privacy, and the potential for broad
		surveillance/tracking can easily occur.

		</ol>
	</ol>
<li> Attack(er)s
	<ol>
	<li> <em>Active</em> attacks attempt to alter data or change the
		actions/behavior of a computer system. Whereas, <em>passive</em>
		attacks focus on simply obtaining information (often
		making them far harder to detect).
	<li> While most efforts focus on attacks conducted by <em>outsiders</em>
		(i.e., persons external to an organization), <em>insider</em>
		attacks are often the most difficult to protect against (and
		can be the most devasting -
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a>).
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare">Cyberwarfare</a>
		not only encompasses hacking by government agents (e.g.,
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398">PLA Unit 61398</a>)
		into computer systems of interest (whether private, public, or
		governmental) but also includes the development and release
		of computer worms/viruses
		(e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">Stuxnet</a>),
		<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/12/29/report-nsa-intercepting-laptops-ordered-online-installing-spyware/">spyware</a>,
		and similar softwares.
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie">Script-kiddie</a>
		is a pejorative term used to describe unskilled persons that
		use software (scripts) developed by others to gain
		unauthorized access to computer systems and their data.
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_scanner">Port scanning</a>
		is a common method to discover computer systems and their
		potential vulnerabilities. It queries port numbers on a range
		of IP addresses to discover open ports and infer what software
		is running on that port. Once this is known, specific attacks
		tailored to the known vulnerabilities of that software can
		be conducted.
	<li> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet">botnet</a> is
		a group of networked zombie (compromised) computers that are
		used to conduct illegal activities on a massive scale.
		Activities can be more mundane (e.g., sending of spam email)
		to extraordinary (e.g., distributed denial-of-service attacks
		upon critical infrastructure).
	</ol>
<li> Trusted Computing Base (TCB)
	<ol>
	<li> It is possible to build (more) secure systems, but they are
		generally:
		<ol>
		<li> More expensive to create (due to more careful development
			practices and more extensive testing);
		<li> Provide less functionality - e.g., passive vs dynamic
			web pages (increased complexity increases
			the amount of testing needed to ensure correctness);
		<li> Would likely require the replacement of a customer's
			existing software (an expensive proposition); and
		<li> Are seen as uncertain investments since a security breach
			isn't a certainty (and many organizations are willing
			to make the - often short term - gamble that the cost
			of a breach will be less than the cost of making
			their systems secure).
		</ol>
	<li> A <em>trusted sytem</em> is one that meets a formally stated set
		of security requirements.
	<li> The TCB is a set of hardware and software that provides the
		basis for a <em>trusted system</em>. This includes:
		<ol>
		<li> Most of the hardware (except I/O devices not involving
			security);
		<li> Portions of the OS kernel (e.g., process creation,
			process switching, memory management, interrupt
			handling, some file and I/O management functions); and
		<li> Programs that run with superuser (administrator or root)
			permissions.
		</ol>
	<li> The TCB is not the entire OS, but is the minimal part upon which
		everything else depends. By keeping the TCB as small as
		practical, it's correctness is easier to verify.
	<li> The <em>reference monitor</em> within a TCB intercepts all system
		calls with a potential impact on security, enabling all
		security decisions to occur in a single place.
	<li> If an existing system can be redesigned to include a TCB, then
		many of the impediments to secure systems might be avoided.
	</ol>
