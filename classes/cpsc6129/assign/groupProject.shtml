	<strong>CPSC 6129: Group Project</strong>
</p>

<p>
There is a (nearly) semester long group project as part of this course.
The project involves taking a new language, learning how to write
significant programs in that language, and presenting to the rest of the
class (via classnotes and video based in large part on the experience
of your group in learning and using the language) your group's:
	<ol>
	<li> Tutorial(s) for programming in the language;
	<li> Techniques and idioms for efficient use of the language's
		capabilities;
	<li> Traps and pitfalls to be wary of when using the language;
	<li> A critical analysis of the language (the good, the bad, and the
		ugly);
	<li> Comparison of major features in the language to counterparts in
		other languages that members of the group are familiar with
		(e.g., from CPSC 5132, other courses, work experience); and
	<li> Suggestions, if any, for how the language might be improved
		within its design objectives.
	</ol>
In order to help keep everyone on track (it's all too easy to postpone
things) the below schedule must be adhered to (failure to do so will result
in point deductions):
	<ol>
	<li> <a name="experience"></a><em>[Saturday, 23 Aug] Student Experience:</em>
		<blockquote>
		Post the list of languages you are fimilar with to the
		Yahoo group for this course. Include the name of the language,
		a link to a description of the language, and an indication
		of your knowledge level:
		<blockquote>
			<dl>
			<dt>Familiar</dt><dd>Have read about the language
				and am familiar with its capabilities, but
				not able to pick up code and read it with
				complete understanding.</dd>
			<dt>Reader</dt><dd>Able to read code for a significant
				program written in the language, but have
				never written a program on your own.</dd>
			<dt>Novice</dt><dd>Have written simple (i.e., toy)
				programs in the language, and would be able
				to augment more complex programs that someone
				else had written.</dd>
			<dt>Advanced</dt><dd>Have written significant (and
				non-trivial) programs in the language.</dd>
			</dl>
		</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
	<li> <a name="assign"></a><em>[Wednesday, 27 Aug] Group and Language Assignment:</em>
		<blockquote>
		Assignment of people (and languages) to groups will be
		posted by the instructor.
		</blockquote>
	<li> <a name="install"></a><em>[Sunday, 7 Sep] Language Install:</em>
		<blockquote>
		Groups shall ensure that everyone in their team has downloaded,
		installed, and confirmed operation of their language system
		by executing at least one of the sample programs that (nearly?)
		all languages come with. A link to a "video" transcript of
		(compilation and) execution of such a program must be emailed
		to the instructor by each member of the group (you can
		post your video to youtube.com as "unlisted" if you don't want
		anyone else to see it - except those to whom you give the
		link).
		</blockquote>
	<li> <a name="descriptions"></a><em>[Saturday, 20 Sep] Program Descriptions:</em>
		<blockquote>
		Your group must email to the instructor a list of 3-5 program
		descriptions for
		review. These are programs that you feel are sufficiently
		significant to illustarte all of the major features of your
		assigned programming langauge. The descriptions should be
		detailed enough that you could give them to someone else as
		a programming assignment. Be sure to outline at the top of
		each program description which of your group's language
		features it is meant to illustrate.
		</blockquote>
	<li> <a name="approvals"></a><em>[Saturday, 4 Oct] Program Approvals:</em>
		<blockquote>
		After (perhaps multiple rounds of) feedback from the instructor
		have been incorporated into the program descriptions, the
		instructor will approve which should be implemented by the
		group as part of its project. All approved programs should be
		incorporated into the group's presentation (though the group is
		free to include more - and probably smaller - examples within
		their presentation in order to focus on key issues more
		directly).
		</blockquote>
	<li> <a name="present"></a><em>[Monday of the week prior to your scheduled presentation] Presentation Notes:</em>
		<blockquote>
		Email your instructor html versions of your notes suitable for
		posting on the course web site. These notes must be the basis
		for your video presentation, but should include more detail
		than you are likely able to cover in the video. Ideally other
		students in the class should print these notes and be able to
		make substantial annotations to them as a result of watching
		the video presentation. <em>This deadline enables the
		instructor to make these materials available to the rest
		of the class in a timely manner.</em>
		</blockquote>
	<li> <em>[Friday of the week proir to your scheduled presentation] Presentation Video:</em>
		<blockquote>
		Email your instructor the youtube.com link to your presentation
		video(s). It is <em>strongly</em> recommended that you
		divide your presentation into more consumable chunks of 10-20
		minutes each. Please given a short phrase that describes the
		topic of each video segment.  <em>This deadline enables the
		instructor to make these materials available to the rest
		of the class in a timely manner.</em>
		</blockquote>
	<li> <a name="programs"></a><em>[Sunday, 23 Nov] Approved Programs:</em>
		<blockquote>
		Email the instructor the completed programs that were
		previously approved for your group. Be sure to include any
		instructions on how to (compile and) execute your programs,
		providing descriptions of the desired input along with
		sample input files.
		</blockquote>
	<li> <a name="test"></a><em>[Sunday, 30 Nov] Test Questions:</em>
		<blockquote>
		<em>Each member</em> of the group should email the instructor
		a list of:
			<ol>
			<li> 10 true/false questions;
			<li> 10 multiple choice questions (with 5 choices
				for each question); and
			<li> 5 short answer/paragraph questions of a more
				open-ended nature.
			</ol>
		These questions should be specific to the language assigned
		to your group. <em>You must include what you feel to be the
		correct answer for each of your questions.</em> The questions
		should not be trivial, but must be answerable based on your
		group's presentation (published notes and videos).
		</blockquote>
	<li> <a name="assess"></a><em>[Saturday, 6 Dec] Assessments:</em>
		<blockquote>
		Each member of every group should email the instructor their
		own assessment of every group's presentations (including your
		own group) as well as an assessment of the contributions of
		the members of their group toward their own group's work
		(including yourself).
		Everyone in the class should submit their own assessment (in
		pdf format) resembling the following organizational structure:
			<blockquote>
			<dl>
			<dt><strong>My Name:</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				J Dana Eckart
				</dd>
			<dt><strong>My Group (Language):</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				Group #0 (C++)
				</dd>
			<dt><strong>Group Grades:</strong></dt>
				<dd>
					<ul>
					<li> Group #0: B+
						<blockquote>
						While the presentation notes
						were very complete and our
						group was able to demonstrate
						the novel features of C++ using
						several intriguing examples,
						our video presentations were
						poor (just reading from the
						notes). We should have expanded
						more on how to effectively use
						the language rather than just
						"reading the code". I did think
						that our Lisp interpreter
						program was really cool (and
						well received), even though
						it was really too large to
						adequately cover in the time
						allotted for the video
						presentations.
						</blockquote>
					<li> Group #1: A-
						<blockquote>
						A good job with both the notes
						and videos. The program
						examples were very engaging
						and helped me better understand
						the notes and how (and when) to
						use this language.
						</blockquote>
					<li> Group #2: C-
						<blockquote>
						The video presentation was
						very uninspired and delivered
						in a monotone. I had to watch
						it several times because I kept
						falling asleep. The notes read
						like the IRS tax code. I would
						find it <em>very</em> difficult
						to write a program in this
						language based on the group's
						presentation materials.
						</blockquote>
					<li> Group #3: A
						<blockquote>
						This group did an all around
						great job. They left me with
						a real desire to learn the
						language (I'll be downloading
						and trying it out after the
						semester is over) and I feel
						that I could very quickly
						start writing significant
						programs based on their
						presentation materials.
						</blockquote>
					<li> Group #4: B-
						<blockquote>
						While the notes and video
						presentations were pretty good,
						the programs they used to
						demonstrate the capabilities
						of the language seemed too
						contrived and were very much
						"toy" programs. While I could
						begin writing programs based
						on their presentation materials,
						I would have a hard time doing
						anything more significant than
						a simple input/output based
						program that included minimal
						data/computational processing.
						</blockquote>
					</ul>
				</dd>
			<dt><strong>My Group's Members' Grades:</strong></dt>
				<dd>
					<ul>
					<li> J Dana Eckart: B
						<blockquote>
						I felt I did my fair share of
						the work. I focused most of
						my effort on the Lisp
						Interpreter program, along
						with the corresponding notes
						and video presentation.
						</blockquote>
					<li> Bullwinkle J Moose: C-
						<blockquote>
						While a nice guy, Bullwinkle
						seemed to struggle with the
						material. He tried to work on
						one of our group's 4 example
						programs (the simplest one),
						but ended up having to hand
						it over to Rocky to complete.
						He did most of the work on
						our video presentation, but
						unfortunately ended up just
						reading the notes that Rocky
						and I had put together.
						</blockquote>
					<li> Rocket "Jet" Squirrel: A+
						<blockquote>
						Rocky did a fantastic job of
						helping the group stay focused
						and making sure that we met
						our deadlines. He was
						responsible for most of the
						remaining example programs.
						</blockquote>
					</ul>
				</dd>
			<dt><strong>Project Experience & Logistics:</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				I really appreciated that the instructor broke
				the project down into pieces that had due dates
				throughout the semester. Without this, I think
				it would have been all to easy to procrastinate
				and end up in a very difficult spot towards
				the end of the semester. At times, the
				communication lag between group members was
				longer than I felt comfortable with - though
				this was almost always due to members being
				time shifted a few hours as well as varying
				work schedules (and being on-call for work).
				Not really sure how to make that any better
				though.
				</dd>
			<dt><strong>Feedback to Instructor:</strong></dt>
				<dd>
				Overall this was a positive group project
				experience for me. Group projects are always
				difficult to organize. I think that 3 people
				in the group was a perfect size. One group
				had 4 people and another had 2 (apparently
				someone dropped the class) and from what I
				say in the discussion list having 4 people
				was too many to coordinate with and 2 people
				had great difficulty in getting the work done.
				Perhaps you could delay the formation of the
				groups by a week (to avoid having groups with
				too few people when someone withdraws from
				the course).
