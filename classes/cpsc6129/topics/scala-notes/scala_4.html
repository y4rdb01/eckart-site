<ol>
<li> 
	<b>Overview</b><br/>
	<ul>
	<li>Though Scala has full support for functions and functional programming, functions are not top-level constructs in Scala
	<li>While we are able to enter unenclosed functions into the Scala REPL, when we are writing program code for compilation, functions must sit inside of a top-level construct
	<li>Scala supports 4 top-level constructs:
		<ol>
		<li>Objects
		<li>Classes
		<li>Case classes
		<li>Traits
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<br/>

<li>
	<b>Objects</b><br/>
	<ul>
	<li>Objects have been given previous treatment
	<li>The <b>object</b> keyword creates a type and a single instance of it
	<li>Common Scala practice generally utilizes companion objects, which hold static class behavior, while instance-specific behavior is encapsulated in the classes themselves
	<li>Related classes and objects can have the same name, which is a common practice in Scala
	</ul>
	<br/>

<li>
	<b>Classes</b><br/>
	<ul>
	<li>Classes have been given previous treatment
	<li>Important points to reiterate include:
		<ol>
		<li>Constructor parameters are integrated into the class definition signatures
		<li>Common practice of "companion objects," which hold static code associated with instance-specific class code
		</ol>
	<li>Inheritence works similar to Java, in that classes can be extended to form subclasses
	<li>Abstract classes are supported
	<li>Traits and mixins can also be combined to form new classes (see below)
	</ul>
	<br/>

<li>
	<b>Case Classes</b><br/>
	<ul>
	<li>Case classes care immutable data objects that depend exclusively on their constructor arguments
	<li>This is a functional concept, and allows pattern matching to be brought to objects, and implicit equality comparisons to be defined
	<li>Case classes can be further investigated <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/107">here</a>
	</ul>
	<br/>


<li>
	<b>Traits & Mixins</b><br/>
	<ul>
	<li>Similar to interfaces in Java
	<li>Collections of attributes and behaviors that can be extended by, or mixed in to, your classes
	<li>Creating new classes by extending other classes or traits, and adding in additional characteristics by selecting additional traits, is referred to as <b>mixin composition</b>.

	<pre><code>
	/** Define a few traits. */

	trait SmartPhone {
	    val make: String
	    val screenSize: Double
	}

	trait Android {
	    val androidVersion: Double
	}

	// Use a single trait with keyword 'extends'.
	class Samsung extends SmartPhone {
	    val make = "Samsung"
	    val screenSize = 4.8
	}

	// Use several traits with additional keyword 'with' (mixin composition).
	class Samsung extends SmartPhone with Android {
	    val make = "Samsung"
	    val screenSize = 4.8
	    val androidVersion = 5.0
	}
	</pre></code>

	</ul>

<li>
	<b>Getters & Setters</b><br/>
	<ul>
	<li>Unlike Java, getters and setters are not <b>really</b> required, at least not in the default case
	<li>The division of vars and vals makes controlling access to, and mutation of, attributes more defined
	<li>vals are not mutable, and so attempting to access and change them is not possible
	<li>vars, on the other hand, are mutable, and so direct access to change them is reasonable
	<li>The default visibility in Scala is <b>public</b>, as it is reasoned that this is the most popular visibility, and so this strategy of expecting direct access to vars and vals is reasonable in the general case
	<li>Of course, Scala provides different visibility scopes, and so classes and methods can be implemented according to requirements, but as a default, this previously outlined practice works quite well, and cuts down on unnecessary and repetitive typing (excessive use of <b>final</b>, <b>public</b>, and constant implementations of setVar, getVar, getVal, etc.)
	<li>For more on visibility scopes in Scala, see <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/scala_access_modifiers.htm">here</a>
	</ul>
	<br/>

<li>
	<b>The Uniform Access Principle</b><br/>
	<ul>
	<li>The Uniform Access Policy states that, "[a]ll services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation." [<a href="http://joelabrahamsson.com/learning-scala-part-nine-uniform-access/">here</a>]
	<li>Simply put, the syntax used to access some part of a class should be the same whether an attribute or a method
	<li>In Java, this does not hold:

	<pre><code>
	// Create an instance of MyClass.
	MyClass a = new MyClass();

	// Access myVar and myMethod.
	int i = a.myVar;
	String s = a.myMethod();
	</pre></code>

	<li>As you can see, the empty parentheses at the end of the method call are not present at the end of the method call, != Uniform Access Principle
	<li>However, thanks to its flexible syntax, this is true of Scala:

	<pre><code>
	// Create an instance of MyClass.	
	val a: MyClass = new MyClass
	
	// Access myVar and myMethod.
	val i = a.myVar
	val s = a.myMethod
	</pre></code>

	<li>The imprints of both of these calls match, and therefor stasify the Uniform Access Principle
	<li>While not a practical requirement of an effective language, that Scala satsifies this principle is a testament to its academic and functional roots
	</ul>
	<br/>
