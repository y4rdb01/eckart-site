On the Knapsack program:
	Unzip into a directory, the code is in src folder.
	Just use scalac and javac to compile, and run the scala program.
	The Scala program uses the java class to illustrate how seamlessly
	scala works with java.

For the Stat and Matrix programs, we used SBT (simple build tool) for scala,
so you need to have SBT installed to run the programs.  

	SBT can be downloaded and installed here:

	Windows -> http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html

	Linux -> http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html

To run the programs, unzip to a directory and navigate to that directory (ie. unzip to ~/stat then cd ~/stat)
The code is in the src folder but you run sbt from the base folder.
To run type sbt "<program_name> <args1> <arg2> ..."
In order to have command line args you must use the quotes.

Both Stat and Matrix accept filename as command line arguments,
but both can be run without arguments and have files loaded from the REPL

Both Stat and Matrix have a testData folder, with included testData files.

To access type:
	sbt "Matrix testData/testMatrixA  testData/testMatrixB"

	This will load both files. Matrix can have as many arg files as you
	want. If it can't find one (or more of the files) it will still load
	the ones it can find and let you know what was loaded and not loaded.
	Matirx requires all matrix files be comma delimited.

Stat accecpts both comma delimited and space delimited.  If you use comma
delimited in Stat it must end in .csv.  If your file has a different extension
(or no extension) it is assumed to be space delimited.

We wanted to use SBT to demonstrate the tools that are available for Scala
(much like ANT for java).
