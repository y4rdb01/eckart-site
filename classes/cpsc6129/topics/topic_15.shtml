	<strong>Dr. J Dana Eckart</strong>: Advanced Programming Languages (CPSC 6129)

<ol>
<li> The book for this course, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1934356999">The
	Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference</a> is very detailed and includes
	numerous examples of how to use the system. In an attempt to avoid
	repeating those examples, an extended example based on the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a>
	programming language will be used. However, please note that no attempt
	will be made to implement all of Forth, though enough will be done
	to enable useful computations and to give a substantial introduction
	to Forth (as well as to ANTLR 4). 
<li> Why Forth? While it's an older language, dating back to the early 1970s,
	it's still in use today. Forth's most notable feature is that it's a
	stack based language, differentiating it from most (all?) of the
	languages you've likely come in direct contact with. It is certainly
	different from Lisp, Prolog, C++, Smalltalk, and NetLogo that are
	covered in <a href="../../cpsc5135">CPSC 5135</a>.  Exposure to yet
	another programming language paradigm is a great opportunity.
<li> There are three published standards for Forth, from 1979, 1983, and 1994. 
	While only a subset of Forth will likely be implemented as an extended
	example for this course, I'll endeavor to conform to the latest
	version as much as practical:
	<ol>
	<li> <a href="../forth/Forth-79.pdf">Forth-79 Standard</a>
	<li> <a href="../forth/FORTH83.txt">Forth-83 Standard</a>
	<li> <a href="../forth/Forth-94.pdf">Forth-94 Standard</a>
	<li> <a href="../forth/stdref-94.pdf">Standard Forth-94 Reference</a>
	<li> <a href="../forth/forth-2012-rc2.pdf">Forth-200x (RC2)</a>
	</ol>
<li> Learning a language from a reference manual/standard is not generally
	very easy, so here are some on-line tutorials which should help you
	get acclimated quickly, making it easier to understand the example
	ANTLR 4 code for Forth:
