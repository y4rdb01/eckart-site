	- Regular Expressions
</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular
	Expressions</a> are frequently used to describe the various sequences
	of characters that make up the lexical elements (i.e., tokens) in
	a programming language.
<li> Regular expressions have the same expressive power as a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton">
	Deterministic Finite (State) Automaton</a> (DFSA or DFA).
<li> Because DFAs have no "memory" of what's been previously recognized, they
	(along with Regular Expressions since they are equivalent to one
	another) are <strong>un</strong>able to recognize something as
	simple as a palindrom of arbitrary length. While you can use the
	various states in a DFA to "remember" palindromes of a bounded
	length (say all those less than 5 characters long), you can't use
	them to determine whether or not strings of arbitrary length are
	in fact palindromes.
<li> Despite this limitation, regular exrepssions
	are well suited for recognizing the keywords, identifiers, literal
	values (e.g., numbers, strings), and comments found in programming
	languages.
<li> Here are several "cheat sheets" that you might find handy for developing
	regular expressions used by the ANTLR lexer:
