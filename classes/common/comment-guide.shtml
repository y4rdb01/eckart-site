	<strong>Code Commenting Guidelines</strong>
</p>

<p>
The following guidelines are due to Bjarne Stroustrup and appear on page 105
(2nd edition) of his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Programming-Language-4th-Edition/dp/0321563840/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1387753139&sr=8-1&keywords=Bjarne+Stroustrup">The C++ Programming Language</a>.
Comments in <em>[emphasis and brackets]</em> are my own.
</p>

<blockquote>
Stroustrup's preference is for:
<ol>
	<li> a comment for each source file stating what the declarations
		in it have in common, references to manuals, general hints
		for maintenance, etc.;
	<li> a comment for each class <em>[module of package]</em> or
		template <em>[generic]</em>;
	<li> a comment for each nontrivial function stating its purpose,
		the algorithm used (unless it is obvious), and maybe
		something about the assumptions it makes about its
		environment;
	<li> a comment for each global variable;
	<li> a few comments in places where the code is nonobvious and/or
		nonportable; and
	<li> very little else.
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
I would also add to the above that comments should bridge the gap between
problem and code.  That is, comments should help the reader of the program
understand how the code solves the problem.
</p>

<p>
This
<a href="ListPrimes.java">program</a> illustrates the kind
of commenting style I want you to use.
