	<strong>CPSC 5135: Assignment #5</strong>
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Using the NetLogo system, you are to build a simulation of traffic flow in a
single direction along a 2 lane highway. Cars will travel east to west (right
to left) having various target speeds and will change lanes under certain
circumstances.  The universe of patches should be 256 wide (east to west) and
6 tall (north to south). Each patch should be displayed as 8 pixels to a side.
</p>

<p>
Your simulation should implement the following microscopic behaviors with
respect to the individual turtles and patches. Furthermore, please note
the restrictions on these behaviors.  Be particularlly carefully to verify
that your simulation correctly implements these microscopic behaviors.
<ol>
<li> Vehicles are implemented as turtles.
<li> All vehicles travel in the same direction (right to left).
<li> Patches representing traffic lanes (which are adjacent) should be
	colored white and non-traffic lanes colored black.
<li> There are two groups/varieties of vehicles
	<ol>
	<li> One variety (Green) travels at speeds uniformly distributed between
		50 and 60 (inclusive). These vehicles are colored green.
	<li> The other variety (Red) travels at speeds uniformly distributed
		between 55 and 65 (inclusive). These vehicles are colored red.
	</ol>
<li> All vehicles are triangular in shape.
<li> The slow(er) lanes of traffic are at the bottom with the fast(er) lanes
	going up the display. The very bottom and very top row of patches
	should always be non-roadway.
<li> During initialization, Red and Green vehicles should be placed on the
	roadway with no preference for slow(er) or fast(er) traffic lanes.
<li> The speed of a vehicle should be implemented as it's (fractional) amount
	of movement in a given time tick. To make this easier, if a vehicle
	is currently traveling at 55, then it covers 0.55 units of distance
	during each time tick.
<li> Vehicles try to maintain their target speeds. Slowing down or speeding
	up as the vehicles in front of them require or permit.
<li> Only one vehicle is allowed in a patch at any one time.  [NOTE: This is
	also true for the initial placement of vehicles as well.] In order to
	prevent more than one vehicle being in a patch at the same time,
	vehicles should (in order of preference):
	<ol>
	<li> change lanes;
	<li> slow down; or
	<li> stop
	</ol>
	[NOTE: You may find it useful to use patch variables to indicate
		whether or not a vehicle currently occupies the patch.]
<li> A vehicle may change lanes when the patch representing the traffic lane
	to the side is empty.  Note that the patch isn't necessarily directly
	to the side, but could be forward as you must still account for the
	forward movement of the vehicle.
<li> A vehicle in the fast lane should stay there unless changing lanes would
	enable it to avoid slowing down, or if there is a car in the patch
	behind it who's target speed is strictly greater than its own.
<li> If a vehicle is in the patch ahead, and the vehicle in the patch behind
	is unable to change lanes, then the vehicle in the patch behind
	must adjust its speed so as not to enter the occupied patch. Only the
	minimal amount of slow-down necessary to achieve this must be utilized.
</ol>
When implementing the above behaviors, it would be best to start simple (e.g.,
one lane of traffic) and then add the code for additional rules (and more
complex behaviors) gradually (and one at a time where possible).
</p>

<p>
Your NetLogo simulation should also implement an appropriate interface
that enables the user to perform the following actions (including
the adjustment of certain values used in the simulation):
<table style="text-align: center; margin: auto; width: 70%">
<tr>
	<th style="text-align: right">
	Control Type
	</th>
	<th style="text-align: center">
	Name
	</th>
	<th style="text-align: left">
	Description
	</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align: right">
	Button
	</td>
	<td>
	Initialize
	</td>
	<td style="text-align: left">
	Sets up the universe and creates the roadway and vehicles per the
	other controls (and the above rules).
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align: right">
	Button
	</td>
	<td>
	Run
	</td>
	<td style="text-align: left">
	Repeatedly carries out the movement and interactions of the turtles
	until clicked again.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align: right">
	Slider
	</td>
	<td>
	relativeMixture
	</td>
	<td style="text-align: left">
	Controls the relative mixture of Red vs Green vehicles. The slider
	should be horizontal and the left-most position indicates that all
	vehicles are Red, the right-most that all vehicles are Green (with
	the center position being a 50/50 mix (on average). The increments
	should be in single units (0 to 100). You can think of this as the
	percentage of vehicles that should be of the Green variety.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align: right">
	Slider
	</td>
	<td>
	vehicleDensity
	</td>
	<td style="text-align: left">
	Ranging from 0 to 100, this horizontal slider indicates what
	percentage of the roadway patches should be (on average) covered
	by vehicles.
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Once you have your simulation fully functional, use it to answer the following
questions which you <strong>must</strong> include at the bottom of (after) the
code as a large set of comments:
<ol>
<li> With 1/3 of the cars being Red and 2/3 of them Green, what's the lowest
	vehicle density at which you start to see traffic congestion (i.e.,
	vehicles starting to form one or more clumps)?
<li> Reversing the mixture, with 2/3 of the cars being Red and 1/3 of them
	Green, what's the lowest vehicle density at which you start to see
	traffic congestion (i.e., vehicles starting to form one or more clumps)?
<li> Is there a difference between the densities at which congestion
	begins to develop for the different vehicle mixtures? Qualitatively
	describe what you observe.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
As always, be sure to use good indentation, descriptive constant, variable,
type, function, procedure, and class names.  Use named constants when
appropriate.  Also use good commenting style, remembering that the first
thing in any program file should be a comment that gives a brief overview
of what the file contains (and should do).  You might find these
<a href="../../common/comment-guide.shtml">commenting guidelines</a> helpful.
</p>

<p>
Finally, please only submit your source code file(s) for the assignment
(e.g., traffic.nlogo). In particular, do <em>not</em> submit zip, jar, tar, or
other collections/archives.
</p>

<h3 align=center>But Wait, There's More!</h3>

<p>
If you are enrolled in the <em>graduate section</em> of this class, then you
must also implement the following additional behavior rule(s):
<ol>
	<li> Allow up to 4 lanes of traffic
	<li> When changing lanes to avoid slowing down, switching to a
		faster lane of traffic (rather than a slower lane) should
		have preference. Remember that faster lanes should be above
		(north of) the slower lanes.
</ol>
as well as these additional interface element(s):
<ol>
	<li> Add an additional horizontal slider that chooses between 1 and 4
		lanes of traffic.
</ol>
After answering the above simulation result questions for 2 lanes of traffic,
try 3 and 4 lanes and describe the qualitative differences that you see using
the additional lanes of traffic.
