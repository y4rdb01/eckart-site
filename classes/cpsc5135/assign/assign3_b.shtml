</p>

<hr>

<p>
Using the C++ programming language (and the GNU g++ compiler),
you are to write a program that simulates the actions of a traveling
salesman who uses an interesting algorithm for deciding which contact (e.g.
potential customer) to visit next.  As calls come in on his cell phone,
the salesman writes down the contact's information, including the contact's
location and the estimated time it will take to meet with the contact, on
a 3x5 index card (so our salesman is still a bit "old school" in some ways).
Cards are placed at the front of a index card file as
they are received.  After the salesperson has finished meeting with a contact,
he needs to select the next contact to visit.  In making his selection, our
intrepid salesman looks at the two (2) cards at the front of his index
card file and selects the contact closest to his current location as the
next one to meet with.  The other of the two (2) cards is replaced in the
front of the index card file.  If both contacts are exactly the same
distance away, then preference should be given to the oldest call.
If there is only one (1) card in the file,
then the salesmen goes there and if there are no cards, our traveler hangs
out in the local bookstore until another call comes in.
</p>

<p>
Calls to the salesmen will be represented as a data file.  Each line of the
data file will represent a separate call.  Each line contains the time at
which the call was received, a two coordinate (x, y) location for the
contact [the salesman starts off at location (0, 0)], and the estimated time
that it will take for the meeting.  Thus each call is represented by four
numbers (integers actually).  Assume that times and time durations are given
in minutes and that the loations are given as locations on a mile delineated
grid.  Here is an <a href="salesman_data">example input file</a>.
</p>

<p>
Your program should read in the data representing calls and simulate the
actions of the saleman as he makes his rounds.  In doing so, you will need
to keep various statistics and report these after all the calls in the data
file have been dealt with.  It should be apparent at this point that you
should use a stack to represent the index card file and that the each line
of the data file should only be read when the time in the simulation matches
that of the call (otherwise the salesman could end up taking calls before
they are placed).  Your program should report the following statistics:
<ul>
<li> The final ending time of the simulation;
<li> The amount of time the salesman spent in bookstores;
<li> The amount of time the salesman spent in meetings with clients;
<li> The amount of time the salesman spent on the road (assume that
	our salesman travels at 60 mph (i.e. 1 mile per minute);
<li> The average amount of time that a contact had to wait before meeting
	with the salesman; and
<li> The longest amount of time that a contact had to wait before meeting
	with the salesman.
</ul>
For simplicity, assume that once the salesman has decided to meet with a
particular contact, he will not divert to another contact based on new
calls, even if they are closer.
Here is an <a href="salesman_result">example output file</a> that
corresponds to the <a href="salesman_data">example input file</a> mentioned
above.
</p>

<p>
Your solution should define a <em>Stack</em> class as a template. It
should be able to hold exactly 32 stack entries, and must hide its
implementation. Here are the functions and public methods it must make
available:
<table style="text-align: center; margin: auto;">
<tr><th style="text-align:left">Methods (and Friends)</th><th style="text-align:left">Description</th></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">void pop()</td><td style="text-align:left">Removes the top entry from the stack.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">void push(TYPE)</td><td style="text-align:left">Pushes a new entry onto the stack.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">TYPE top()</td><td style="text-align:left">Returns the current top of the stack.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">bool empty()</td><td style="text-align:left">True iff the stack is empty.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">bool full()</td><td style="text-align:left">True iff the stack is full.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">friend ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const Stack&)</td><td style="text-align:left">Prints entire stack (one entry per line) starting with the top most entry.</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
While C++ supports breaking up your program into multiple files, for the
purposes of this assignment (and to make your professor's grading job
easier), <em>please</em> put all of your code into a single file
named "salesman.cc".
</p>

<p>
You are responsible for creating your own test data. It's a good idea to
create your test cases first, building upon your test data, as this will
help you with your development. Be sure to include a variety of "corner cases"
to ensure that your program doesn't work for only "normal" data.
You can either supply test data at the keyboard (remembering
to end the input with a ^D at the beginning of a line), or by feeding the
contents of a file to it (e.g. a.out &lt; test_data) where the use of the
U<font size=-2>NIX</font> redirection symbol &lt; causes
the contents of the file test_data to be
feed into the program as if they had been typed in from the keyboard.
Test driven development (TDD) is a good practice that you should cultivate.
</p>

<p>
As always, be sure to use good indentation, descriptive constant, variable,
type, function, procedure, and class names.  Use named constants when
appropriate.  Also use good commenting style, remembering that the first
thing in any program file should be a comment that gives a brief overview
of what the file contains (and should do).  You might find these
<a href="../../common/comment-guide.shtml">commenting guidelines</a> helpful.
</p>

<p>
Finally, please only submit your source code file(s) for the assignment
(e.g., salesman.cc). In particular, do <em>not</em> submit zip, jar, tar, or
other collections/archives.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Good luck!</strong>
</p>

<p>
If you are enrolled in the <em>graduate section</em> of this class, then you
must also implement appropriate exceptions and exception handlers for the
following conditions (all error messages - if any - should be printed to
<em>cerr</em>):
<table style="text-align: center; margin: auto;">
<tr><th style="text-align:left">Exception</th><th style="text-align:left">Raised When...</th><th style="text-align:left">How to Handled</th></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">StackOverflow</td><td style="text-align:left">Attempt to push more items onto the stack than it can hold</td><td style="text-align:left">Indicate problem to user (stack remains unchanged).</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:left">StackUnderflow</td><td style="text-align:left">Attempt to use item(s) from an empty stack</td><td style="text-align:left">Indicate problem to user (stack remains unchanged).</td></tr>
</table>
