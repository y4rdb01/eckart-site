<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a default 2-dimensional patch universe.
	At time zero have the bottom left-most patch create a single
	turtle with an initial heading toward the east (i.e., right). On
	odd time steps the turtle should move forward one step, while on
	even time steps the turtle should not move, but simply change its
	heading by turning left 90 degrees if the sum of its patch's
	x and y coordinates is even, and turning right 90 degrees if the sum
	of the patch's x and y coordinates is odd.
</li><br/>
<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a 2-dimensional patch universe of
	size 64 by 64. The patch at location (32, 32) should create four
	turtles at time zero, with each turtle heading in a different
	compass direction (i.e., north, south, east, west). At every time
	step, all turtles should travel two steps in the direction they
	are headed, create four turtles with each heading in one of the
	four compass directions, and then the original turtle should
	die.
