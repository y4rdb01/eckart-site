<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a default 2-dimensional patch universe.
	Modify the Schelling segregation model so that it incorporates a
	bias for diversity. The example presented in class only considers the
	number of patch neighbors that are of the same "flavor" as the patch
	itself. The diversity bias makes a patch unhappy (i.e., "happy?" is
	false) if the number of patch neighbors with a different "flavor"
	from the patch is not greater or equal to a cut-off value (determined
	by a slider). The range of diversity bias values should be 0 to 8.

The Nobel laureate economist Thomas Schelling's segregation model
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Is applicable only to wealth inequities in global financial
		markets.
	<li> Shows how small individual differences in preference can lead to
		large impacts that are globally observable over time.
	<li> Demonstrates that personal bias plays little if any role in the
		development of segregated neighborhoods.
	<li> Illustrates how simple models can be used to better understand
		real systems that do not lend themselves to active
		experimentation (e.g., directly altering the real system and
		observing the effects).
	<li> None of the above
