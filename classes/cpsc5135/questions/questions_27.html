<li> Being a first class object means
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Having the ability to implement the object within any scope/block.
	<li> Being able to declare typed object variables and assign the
		object values.
	<li> Having the ability to pass the objects as parameters.
	<li> Being able to return them as subprogram results.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> In C++, which of the following are first class objects?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Primitive types
	<li> Functions/methods
	<li> Classes
	<li> Exceptions
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> In Java, which of the following are first class objects?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Primitive types
	<li> Functions/methods
	<li> Classes
	<li> Exceptions
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> <strong>Both</strong> the Callback and Observer patterns
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Can often make use of simple function pointers to enable
		later event notification handling.
	<li> Require functions/methods as first class objects to enable later
		event notification handling.
	<li> Can be accomplished in Java without the need to embed "handlers"
		within class instances.
	<li> Are little used in modern software systems.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> A closure
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Is a combination of pointers to a subprogram and an
		activation record.
	<li> Requires an access link in the activation record.
	<li> Is unnecessary if subprograms are first class objects but their
		implementations cannot be statically nested within another
		scope.
	<li> Is unnecessary if subprograms are <strong>not</strong>
		first class objects but their implementations can be
		statically nested within another scope.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
