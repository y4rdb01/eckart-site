<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "isEven" which takes a list
	as its only parameter. The predicate should succeed if the number of
	items in the list is even, and should fail if the list contains an odd
	number of items. Thus "isEven([ z ])" and "isEven([ 1, a, 2 ])" should
	fail, but "isEven([ ])" and "isEven([ 1, 2, c, d ])" should succeed.
	Do <strong>not</strong> use the Prolog built-in "length" predicate.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "isOdd" which takes a list
	as its only parameter. The predicate should succeed if the number of
	items in the list is odd, and should fail if the list contains an even
	number of items. Thus "isOdd([ z ])" and "isOdd([ 1, a, 2 ])" should
	succeed, but "isOdd([ ])" and "isOdd([ 1, 2, c, d ])" should fail.
	Do <strong>not</strong> use the Prolog built-in "length" predicate.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "sum" which takes two
	numeric parameters. The predicate confirms that the sum of every
	number starting with zero up to and including the value of the first
	parameter is equal to the value of the second parameter. Thus
	"sum(6, 21)", "sum(2, 3)", and "sum(5, 15)" should
	succeed, but "sum(3, 2)" should fail.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "sum" which takes three
	numeric parameters. The predicate confirms that the sum of every
	number starting with the first parameter, up to and including the
	second parameter is equal to the value of the third parameter. Thus
	"sum(3, 6, 18)", "sum(-2, 2, 0)", and "sum(5, 5, 5)" should
	succeed, but "sum(2, 3, 3)" should fail.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "oddAdd" which takes two
	parameters: a list of numbers; and a number. The predicate confirms
	that the sum of every other number in the list (starting with the
	first number) is given as the second parameter.  Thus
	"oddAdd([ ], 0)" and "oddAdd([2, 3, 5, 7], 7)" should succeed,
	but "oddAdd([ 2, 3 ], 3)" should fail.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "evenAdd" which takes two
	parameters: a list of numbers; and a number. The predicate confirms
	that the sum of every other number in the list (starting with the
	second number) is given as the second parameter.  Thus
	"evenAdd([ ], 0)" and "evenAdd([2, 3, 5, 7], 10)" should succeed,
	but "evenAdd([ 2, 3 ], 2)" should fail.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "last" which takes two
	parameters: a list; and an item. The predicate confirms
	that the item is the last element in the list.  Thus
	"last([ ], [ ])" and "last([2, 3, 5, 7], 7)" should succeed,
	but "last([ 2, 3 ], 2)" should fail.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "nth" which takes three
	parameters: a list; a number index; and an item. The predicate confirms
	that the item is the nth element in the list (with the first element
	being the 1th item).  You can assume that the number index is at least
	1 and less than or equal to the size of the list (with the exception
	of the empty list). Thus "nth([ ], 1, [ ])" and
	"nth([2, 3, 5, 7], 3, 5)" should succeed,
	but "nth([ 2, 3 ], 2, 2)" should fail.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "makeList" which takes two
	parameters: a non-negative integer; and a list. The predicate creates
	a list of the integer values counting down to 1. Thus "makeList(0, [ ])"
	and "makeList(4, [4, 3, 2, 1])" should succeed, but "makeList(2, [ 2 ])"
	and "makeList(3, [ 1, 2, 3])" should fail.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "makeList" which takes two
	parameters: a non-negative integer; and a list. The predicate creates
	a list of the integer values counting up starting from 1. Thus
	"makeList(0, [ ])" and "makeList(4, [1, 2, 3, 4])" should succeed,
	but "makeList(2, [ 2 ])" and "makeList(3, [ 3, 2, 1])" should fail.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "pair" which takes three
	parameters. The first and second parameters are lists of items while
	the third is a list of item pairings from the elements of the first
	two parameters. Thus "pair([], [], [])." and
	"pair([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9], [ [1, 1], [2, 4], [3, 9] ])." should
	succeed, but "pair([1, 2, 3], [1, 4], [ [1, 1], [2, 4] ])." and
	"pair([1, 2, 3], [a, b, c], [ [1, a], [2, b] ])." should fail.
</li><br/>
<li> Write the definitions for the Prolog predicate "where" that takes three
	parameters, an item to find, a list to find the item in, and the
	first position in the list in which the item is located. Positions
	start at 0, and if the item is not in the list the third parameter
	should be -1.  Thus "where(b, [a, b, c], 1)." and
	"where(d, [1, 2], -1)." should both succeed while
	"where(c, [a 1 b 4 c 7 u], 2)." should fail.
