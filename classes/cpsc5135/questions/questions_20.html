<li> Give the implementation for a C++ class called "Power" that has the

		parameter is the "base" and the second is the "expoent". The
		returned result is the base multipled by itself exponent times.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	</blockquote>
	Be sure to hide as much of the details of the implementation as
	possible and define appropriate constructor(s) or other supporting
	functions as necessary.
</li><br/>
<li> Give the implementation for a C++ class called "Prime" that has the
	following public member functions:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>"isPrime"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes a single integer value as its parameter. The function
		returns the integer if it is a prime number and returns 0
		otherwise.

<li> Give the implementation for a C++ class called "Largest" that has the
	following public member functions:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>"newNumber"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes a single integer value as its parameter. If this is the
		first time the method is called, then the parameter is set as
		the largest number seen thus far. If a number has already been
		seen, then the larger of the current largest number and the
		provided parameter is retained.
		</dd>
	<dt>"largest"</dt>

<li> Give the implementation for a C++ class called "Palindrome" that has the
	following public member functions:

		<dd>
		takes a single character value as its parameter
		and adds it to the list of characters. No value is returned.
		</dd>
	<dt>"isPal"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes no parameters but returns 1 if the set of characters
		added thus far is a palindrome (given the order in which they
		were added) and returns 0 otherwise.
		</dd>
	<dt>"clear"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes no parameters and removes <strong>all</strong>
		previously added characters. No value is returned.

	Remember that a string of characters is a palindrome if it reads the

		takes a single character parameter. The character is added to
		the end of the list of characters that have been added thus far.
		</dd>
		<dd>
	<dt>"clear"</dt>
		<dd>
		erases the memory of any characters that have been seen thus
		far, enabling a new set of characters to be examined via the
		"addCharacter" function.
		</dd>
		<dd>
	<dt>"mostOften"</dt>
		<dd>
		returns the character that has been added (via "addCharacter")
		the most number of times since "clear" was last called. If no
		characters have been added, then return the space (' ')
		character.

		and adds it to the list of numbers about which statistics
		can be reported. No value is returned.
		</dd>
	<dt>"largest"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes no parameters but returns the value of the
		largest number added thus far.
		</dd>
	<dt>"mean"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes no parameters but returns the average of
		<strong>all</strong> of the numbers added thus far.
		</dd>
	<dt>"clear"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes no parameters and removes <strong>all</strong>
		previously added numbers. No value is returned.
