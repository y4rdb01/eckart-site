<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a default 2-dimensional patch universe.
	Extend the game of life so that each live patch can be sick. Initially,
	a live patch has a 10% chance of being sick. Patches can only become
	sick when they are born. A patch that is born is sick if any of its
	neighboring patches is also sick. Healthy live
	patches should be colored green while sick live patches are colored
	red.  Sick live patches become healthy after 3 time ticks.
