<li> The key advantage(s) of models being simplified descriptions of real-world
	processes
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Are absent, since some details are missed.
	<li> Is they are easier to understand.
	<li> Are that they can often be reused for a different domain (e.g.,
		a tornado model can be used for huricanes).
	<li> Depend upon the specific process being modeled.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Computed simulation results are used to predict what will happen with a
	real-world process
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> So they usually need to run faster than real-time.
	<li> Making them helpful for experiments that would otherwise
		be too costly to conduct.
	<li> To inform future human actions.
	<li> Over which we have limited control.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> When available, actual real-world data is compared to computed simulation
	results (i.e., predictions) in order to

	<li> Determine what should have happened in the real-world.
	<li> Evaluate the accuracy of the model in specific circumstances.
	<li> Create suitable test data.

	<li> Address a wide variety of scenarios.
	<li> Explain the vast majority of behavior.
	<li> <strong>Always</strong> agree with expert opinions.
