<li> Block structures
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Organize related declarations and statements.
	<li> Can be nested only a limited (though large) number of times.
	<li> Contain only statements - declarations <strong>must</strong>
		be at the class or method level.
	<li> In some languages limit the kinds of declarations they may
		contain (e.g., no function declarations/implementations).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Declarations in a block are
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> visible only within that block - and <strong>not</strong>
		in nested blocks.
	<li> only allocated on the run-time stack (for non-static variables).
	<li> visible in nested blocks unless hidden by nested declarations.
	<li> only allocated on from the heap (for non-static variables).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The scope and lifetime of a variable declaration
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Are <strong>always</strong> the same.
	<li> Are <strong>never</strong> the same.
	<li> Can be different if the variable declaration is hidden in a

	<li> Can be different if the value is allocated in the heap.
	<li> None of the above

<li> The scope of a declaration is
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> The region of the program text the variable resides within the
		symbol table.
	<li> The time period in a running program that the variable/value
		has allocated space.
	<li> The region of the program text in which the declaration is visible.
	<li> Is the same as the lifetime of the variable declaration.
	<li> None of the above

<li> The lifetime of a declaration is
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> The region of the program text the variable resides within the
		symbol table.
	<li> The time period in a running program that the variable/value
		has allocated space.
	<li> The region of the program text in which the declaration is visible.
	<li> Is the same as the scope of the variable declaration.
	<li> None of the above

<li> Which of these are ways to make the scope and lifetime of a variable
	declaration different?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Hide the variable name in the outer scope by declaring a variable
		of the same name within a nested scope.
	<li> For most compilers, declare a variable within an anonymous
		block (so that it's storage allocation would occur within
		the named "parent" block).
	<li> Cannot be done, the scope and lifetime of variable declarations
		are <strong>always</strong> the same.
	<li> Declare the variable as static within a nested scope (e.g., a
		function).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>

<li> Unless specifically indicated otherwise, block structured languages
	(e.g., Java, C++) nearly always allocate memory for variable
	declarations within blocks
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> statically (to reduce the memory footprint).
	<li> on the run-time stack.

	<li> either in the heap or run-time stack, whichever has the most
		space remaining.
	<li> None of the above

</li><br/>
<li> A characteristic of block structured languages is that of the declarations
	supported by the language (e.g., variable, class, function)
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> variable declarations are <strong>always</strong>
		allowed within a block.
	<li> only function declarations (but <strong>not</strong> their

	<li> type (and class) declarations may be given, but only if they are
		anonymous.
	<li> <strong>all</strong> may appear within a block.
