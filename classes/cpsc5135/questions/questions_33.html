<li> Give the implementation for a Smalltalk class called "Power" that has
	no instance variables but the following single method:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>"exp"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes two integer values as its parameters. The first
		parameter is the "base" and the second is the "expoent".
		The returned result is the base multipled by itself exponent
		times. For example, "Transcript showCR: (Power new exp: 2 3)"
		should display "8" as the result.
		</dd>
	</dl>
        Be sure to define appropriate constructor(s) or other supporting
	methods as necessary.

<li> Give the implementation for a Smalltalk class called "Prime" that has
	no instance variables but the following single method:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>"isPrime"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes a single integer value as its parameter. The method
		returns a true value if the integer is a prime number and
		returns false otherwise. 
		</dd>
	</dl>
        Be sure to define appropriate constructor(s) or other supporting
	methods as necessary.
