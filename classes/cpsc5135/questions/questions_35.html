<li> Give the implementation for a Smalltalk class called "Palindrome" that has
	one or more instance variables and the following methods:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>"new"</dt>
		<dd>
		creates a new instance of "Palindrome".
		</dd>
	<dt>"init"</dt>
		<dd>
		initializes the instance with the appropriate default values.
		</dd>
	<dt>"addCharacter"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes a single character parameter. The character is added
		to the end of the list of characters that have been added
		thus far.
		</dd>
	<dt>"isPalindrome"</dt>
		<dd>
		returns a true value if the set of characters forms a
		palindrome, and returns false otherwise.  If no characters
		have been recorded thus far, then return false.
		</dd>
	<dt>"clear"</dt>
		<dd>
		erases the set of characters that have been seen thus far,
		enabling a new set of characters to be constructed via the
		"addCharacter" method.
		</dd>
	</dl>
        Be sure to define appropriate constructor(s) or other supporting
	methods as necessary.

<li> Give the implementation for a Smalltalk class called "Frequent" that has
	one or more instance variables and the following methods:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>"new"</dt>
		<dd>
		creates a new instance of "Frequent".
		</dd>
	<dt>"init"</dt>
		<dd>
		initializes the instance with the appropriate default values.
		</dd>
	<dt>"addCharacter"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes a single character parameter. The character is added
		to the end of the list of characters that have been added
		thus far.
		</dd>
	<dt>"clear"</dt>
		<dd>
		erases the memory of any characters that have been seen thus
		far, enabling a new set of characters to be examined via the
		"addCharacter" method.
		</dd>
	<dt>"mostOften"</dt>
		<dd>
		returns the character that has been added (via "addCharacter")
		the most number of times since "clear" was last called. If
		no characters have been added, then return the space (' ')
		character.
		</dd>
	</dl>
        Be sure to define appropriate constructor(s) or other supporting
	methods as necessary.
