<li> Give the implementation for a Smalltalk class called "Frequent" that has
	one or more instance variables and the following methods:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>"new"</dt>
		<dd>
		creates a new instance of "Frequent".
		</dd>
	<dt>"init"</dt>
		<dd>
		initializes the instance with the appropriate default values.
		</dd>
	<dt>"readFile"</dt>
		<dd>
		queries the user to enter a file name. If there is a problem
		with the indicated file, the method should repeatedly query
		the user until a valid file is given.
		</dd>
	<dt>"mostOften"</dt>
		<dd>
		returns the character that appears most often in the file
		indicated by the most recent call to "readFile".
		</dd>
	</dl>
        Be sure to define appropriate constructor(s) or other supporting
	methods as necessary.
