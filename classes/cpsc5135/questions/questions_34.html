<li> Give the implementation for a Smalltalk class called "Prime" that has
	no instance variables but the following two methods:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>"isPrime"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes a single integer value as its parameter. The method
		returns a true value if the integer is a prime number and
		returns false otherwise. 
		</dd>
	<dt>"checker"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes no parameters but continually asks the user for numeric
		input via a dialog box. The method checks whether or not the
		input was a prime number, printing "Is prime." to the console
		if the number was prime and "Is NOT prime." to the console if
		it was not a prime number. The method ends when the user enters
		a negative number.
		</dd>
	</dl>
        Be sure to define appropriate constructor(s) or other supporting
	methods as necessary.
	</blockquote>
</li><br/>
<li> Give the implementation for a Smalltalk class called "Largest" that has
	one or more instance variables and the following four methods:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>"new"</dt>
		<dd>
		creates a new instance of "Largest".
		</dd>
	<dt>"init"</dt>
		<dd>
		initializes the instance with the appropriate default values.
		</dd>
	<dt>"newNumber"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes a single integer value as its parameter. If this is the
		first time the method is called, then the parameter is set as
		the largest number seen thus far. If a number has already been
		seen, then the larger of the current largest number and the
		provided parameter is retained.
		</dd>
	<dt>"largest"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes no parameters but returns the largest number recorded
		(via calls to "newNumber") thus far.
		</dd>
	</dl>
        Be sure to define appropriate constructor(s) or other supporting
	methods as necessary.
