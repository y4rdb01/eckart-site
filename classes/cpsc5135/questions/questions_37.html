<li> Give the implementation for a Smalltalk class called "Stats" that has
	the following methods:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>"addNumber"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes a single integer value as its parameter
		and adds it to the list of numbers about which statistics
		can be reported. The receiving instance is returned.
		</dd>
	<dt>"largest"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes no parameters but returns the value of the
		largest number added thus far.
		</dd>
	<dt>"mean"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes no parameters but returns the average of
		<strong>all</strong> of the numbers added thus far.
		</dd>
	<dt>"clear"</dt>
		<dd>
		takes no parameters and removes <strong>all</strong>
		previously added numbers. The receiving instance is returned.
		</dd>
	</dl>
	You may assume that no more than 100 numbers will ever be added.
        (before "clear" is called).  Be sure to define appropriate
	constructor(s) or other supporting methods as necessary.
