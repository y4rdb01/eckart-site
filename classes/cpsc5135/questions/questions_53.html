<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a default 2-dimensional patch universe.
	Every patch can have one of two colors: white or black. Initially,
	patches whose x and y coordinates sum to an even number get colored
	white, while all others are colored black. During each timestep,
	each patch changes to display the opposing color.
