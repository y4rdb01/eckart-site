<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a 3-dimensional patch universe.
	Extend the <a href="topics/topic_53.shtml">SRDP model</a> so
	that it works in 3 dimensions rather than just 2 dimensions.
</li><br/>
<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a default 2-dimensional patch universe.
	Each patch should randomly be assigned the value of 0, 1, or 2 (each
	value being equally likely). A single turtle starts in the middle of
	the universe, heading north. During each time tick:
	<ul class="bullet_list">
	<li> Based on the patch value the turtle is in, it turns:
		<ul class="bullet_list">
		<li> left 90 degrees if the patch value is 0,
		<li> 0 degrees and continues in its current direction if
			the patch value is 1, and
		<li> right 90 degrees if the patch value is 2.
		</ul>
	<li> Then the turtle moves forward one unit.
	</ul>
</li><br/>
