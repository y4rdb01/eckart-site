<li> Java processing threads can be created by
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Extending the "Thread" class and overriding the "run" method.
	<li> Calling the "start" method defined by the "Object" class.
	<li> Calling the "fork" method defined by the "Object" class.
	<li> Implementing the "Runnable" interface and its "run" method.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Thread pools are beneficial in that they
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Providing additional multiprocessing resources to the JVM.
	<li> Reuse existing threads, reducing the overhead of thread
		creation and cleanup.
	<li> Enable a more consistent level of system performance by
		limiting the number of active threads.
	<li> Automatically provide support for mutual exclusion.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Communication between Java threads in the same JVM is typically
	accomplished using
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> The Message Passing Interface (MPI)
	<li> Semaphores
	<li> Spin locks
	<li> Shared objects (i.e., memory)
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Java's "synchronized" methods and code blocks implement mutual exclusion
	via
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Spin locks
	<li> Semaphores
	<li> Monitors
	<li> Message Passing
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> In Java, garbage collection is performed as a(n)
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Exception handler for the "OutOfMemoryError" exception.
	<li> Programmer initiated action only.
	<li> Time scheduled event, occurring exactly every 5 minutes.
	<li> Separate concurrent processing thread.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> In the Java Memory Model
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> A single heap is shared by <strong>all</strong> threads.
	<li> A single run-time stack is shared by <strong>all</strong> threads.
	<li> Each thread has its own memory cache.
	<li> Each thread has its own garbage collector.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Write a Java class definition/implementation (called "Shared") that
	hides within it a single "Integer" attribute, prevents threads from
	storing the attribute value in their local cache, and provides 
	generally visible methods "getValue" and "setValue" that get and
	set the value of the hidden "Integer" variable respectively - but
	that only allow a single thread access (either read or write) to
	the "Integer" variable at a time. You may use additional (hidden)
	methods in your solution.
