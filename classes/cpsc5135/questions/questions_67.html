<li> Which of the following is <strong>not</strong> a way to implement
	mutual exclusion?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Spin locks
	<li> Message Passing Interface
	<li> Semaphores
	<li> Monitors
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> When providing mutual exclusion using locks and busy waiting, the algorithm
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Continually sends itself a message, entering the
		<em>critical section</em> when the message is lost.
	<li> Signals the next process to enter the <em>critical section</em>
		just before the previous process exits.
	<li> Keeps processes in the waiting group "busy" until it is their
		turn.
	<li> Must obtain the lock atomically.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> When used to implement mutual exclusion, semaphores utilize
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Specialized cache memories for storing waiting processes.
	<li> A queue of waiting processes.
	<li> Spin locks to implement the Signal (V) operation.
	<li> Two operations called Wait (P) and Signal (V).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The use of monitors for implementing mutual exclusion
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Was developed in the early 1970s.
	<li> Watch the <em>critical section</em> and eject the most recent
		process to enter if there are ever two or more.
	<li> Is more difficult to get correct than using semaphores.
	<li> Rely on a single entry point (e.g., subprogram) to limit access.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The "synchronized" mechanism in Java is an example of
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Spin locking
	<li> The Message Passing Interface
	<li> Semaphores
	<li> Monitors
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The Messaging Passing Interface (MPI)
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Allows <strong>all</strong> processes to be continually active
		(i.e., not waiting).
	<li> Supports only a limited pre-defined set of data types to be
		sent within messages.
	<li> Was developed in the early 2000s.
	<li> Can implement mutual exclusion by passing around a special "token"
		that grants access to the <em>critical section</em>.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
