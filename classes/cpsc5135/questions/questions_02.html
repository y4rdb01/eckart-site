<li> Which of the following are features/properties of <strong>all</strong> modern general
	purpose programming languages?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Turing completeness
	<li> Recursion
	<li> Pattern matching
	<li> Implicit variable declarations
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Which of the following languages were developed before 1965 and are
	still in use today?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> C
	<li> Cobol
	<li> Prolog
	<li> Lisp
	<li> Fortran
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Which of the following was the first major language to introduce
	<strong>both</strong> recursion and garbage collection?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> C
	<li> Cobol
	<li> Prolog
	<li> Lisp
	<li> Fortran
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Why is the study of programming language concepts more beneficial than
	learning multiple programming languages?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Because <strong>all</strong> programming languages use the same small set of
		concepts.
	<li> Knowing concepts makes learning new languages that use them
		much easier.
	<li> You'd have to learn a huge number of languages to cover
		<strong>all</strong> the basic concepts.
	<li> It's not. Learning languages is more important because the
		concepts <strong>always</strong> work together differently.
	<li> It's not, because learning new languages is easier than
		understanding the underlying concepts.
	</ol>
