<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a default 2-dimensional patch universe.
	Initially <strong>all</strong> patches have a random value
	(between 0 and 9) assigned.
	With each time tick, a patch examines the value of its 8 neighbors 
	along with its own value. The current patch changes its value to that
	of a neighboring patch that meets the following conditions:
	<ul class="bullet_list">
	<li> If the current patch has an <em>even</em> value and the
		neighboring patch with the highest value is greater than
		the value of the current patch.
	<li> If the current patch has an <em>odd</em> value and the
		neighboring patch with the lowest value is less than the
		value of the current patch.
	</ul>
</li><br/>
<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a default 2-dimensional patch universe.
	Each patch keeps track of its current temperature (nowTemp) and
	the temperature prior to that (recentTemp). Initially each patch
	is assigned a random temperature from 0 to 100 (inclusive). The
	average nowTemp of the patch's neighbors is calculated.
	<ul class="bullet_list">
	<li> If the neighbor average temperature is greater than the nowTemp
		of the patch, then the patch's new nowTemp becomes the greater
		of the average and the patch's recentTemp.
	<li> Otherwise the patch's new nowTemp becomes the lesser
		of the average and the patch's recentTemp.
	</ul>
	In either case, the patch's recentTemp becomes the value of nowTemp
	(before it is changed).
