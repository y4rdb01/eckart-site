<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a 3-dimensional patch universe.
	Each patch should randomly be assigned the value of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4
	(each value being equally likely). A single turtle starts in the
	middle of the universe, heading up. During each time tick:
	<ul class="bullet_list">
	<li> Based on the patch value the turtle is in, it turns:
		<ul class="bullet_list">
		<li> left 90 degrees if the patch value is 0,
		<li> up 90 degrees if the patch value is 1,
		<li> Continues in its current direction if
			the patch value is 2,
		<li> down 90 degrees if the patch value is 3, and
		<li> right 90 degrees if the patch value is 4.
		</ul>
	<li> Then the turtle moves forward one unit.
	</ul>
</li><br/>
<li> Write a NetLogo program that uses a default 2-dimensional patch universe.
	Populate the universe so that 20% of the patches have a single turtle
	(all other patches are empty). Each turtle should have a random
	heading and a random speed between 0 and 5 inclusive. At each time
	tick turtles move according to their speed and direction. After
	<strong>all</strong> the turtles have moved in a time tick, each
	turtle should examine another randomly chosen turtle that is also in
	its same patch and set its speed and direction to match that
	random turtle.
