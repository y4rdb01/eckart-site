<li> Which of the following are properties of the
	<em>while-loop-end</em> statement?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> It is ambiguous.
	<li> Nesting of <em>while-loop-end</em> statements is allowed.
	<li> The control flow is <strong>always</strong> textually forward.
	<li> The loop <strong>must</strong> execute at least once.
	<li> None of the above

<li> Which of the following are properties of the
	<em>loop-until</em> statement?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> It is ambiguous.
	<li> Nesting of <em>loop-until</em> statements is allowed.
	<li> The control flow is <strong>always</strong> textually forward.
	<li> The loop <strong>must</strong> execute at least once.
	<li> None of the above

<li> Which of the following are properties of the

	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> It is ambiguous.
	<li> Nesting of <em>for-loop-end</em> statements is allowed.

<li> The generalized <em>for-loop-end</em> statement
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Can iterate over collections (using iterators that yield a
		sequence of values).
	<li> <strong>Must</strong> start counting from 0 for index values.
	<li> <strong>Must</strong> incremement by 1 for index values.
	<li> Can simultaneously count over multiple index values.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Which of the following are properties of the generalized
        <em>loop-end</em> (with <em>exit/break</em>) statement?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> It is ambiguous.
	<li> They can completely replace the use of <strong>all</strong>
		other types of looping (e.g., <em>while-loop-end</em>,
		<em>loop-until</em>, <em>for-loop-end</em>).
	<li> The loops can be "named", reducing the need for
		"loop escape flags" by programmers.
	<li> The <em>exit/break</em> statements may appear anywhere in the loop.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The use of multiple <em>exit/break</em> statements within a loop
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Is <strong>not</strong> allowed.
	<li> Is confusing and violates the principle of structured programming.
	<li> In combination with the "when" clause improves readability
		over placing <em>exit/break</em> within an
		<em>if-then-elsif-else-end</em> statement.
	<li> Can lead to spaghetti code.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The "loop and a half" problem (where some of the loop's logic
	<strong>must</strong> be repeated either before or after the loop)
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Is just part of programming, and cannot be circumvented.
	<li> Is best handled by the use of the <em>for-loop-end</em> statement.
	<li> Is best handled by the use of the <em>loop-until</em> statement.
	<li> Can often be eliminated by the use of an <em>exit/break</em>
		statement within a generalized <em>loop-end</em>.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> An example violation of the principle of structured programming occurs
	when
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> A "return" statement in a subprogram appears in the middle
		of the subprogram text.
	<li> Multiple "exit" statements appear within a loop.
	<li> A subprogram's "return" statement appears within a loop.
	<li> Multiple "return" statements appear within a subprogram.
