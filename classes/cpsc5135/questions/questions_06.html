<li> Which parts of the processs layout in memory have a fixed size during
	the execution of a compiled (non-interpreted) program?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Heap
	<li> Symbol table
	<li> Run-time stack
	<li> Static variables
	<li> Program comments
	<li> Constants
	<li> Code
	<li> None of the above

<li> Why do the heap and run-time stack <strong>not</strong> have a fixed size
	(during program execution) like the other parts of the process layout
	in memory?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Not true, they do have a fixed size.
	<li> The other parts are completely determined by the program text
		(statically) while the heap and run-time stack sizes depend
		on the input and execution path through the code.
	<li> Not true, they can <strong>all</strong> vary in size during
		program execution.
	<li> Not true, only the heap varies in size, while the run-time stack
		is fixed in size based on the number of declared methods and
		functions.
	<li> Not true, only the run-time stack varies in size since the heap
		size is determined by the number of classes declared in the
		code.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
