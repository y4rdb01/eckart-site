<li> In NetLogo, the "map" command
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Successively applies a command to a list of arguments.
	<li> Assigns (maps) evenly across <strong>all</strong> patches

<li> Unlike patches, turtles in NetLogo can be created
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> By an existing turtle, using the "hatch" command.

<li> In the following NetLogo code snippet,
	<pre><code>
	patches-own [ status? count ]

	to task

			]
		]
		ask patches [
			ifelse 0 = count mod 2
				[ set status? true ]
				[ set status? false ]

	</code></pre>
	using a single "ask patches [...]", rather than the two used above,
	would yield different results because
	<ol class="answer_list">
        <li> Every execution would yield different results (even on the same
		data) whether one (1) or two "ask patches" was used.
        <li> The number of "neighbors" used in the calculation would change.
        <li> Not all of the "count" values would be calculated before the
		setting of "status?" values began.
        <li> They wouldn't, <strong>both</strong> would actually give the
