	- Goto Statements vs Structured Programming
</p>

<ol>
<li> Goto Statements
	<ol>
	<li> Enable a jump to another statement in an executing program.
		Jumps are not limited to only going "forward", but
		may also go "backward" (textually) in the code.
	<li> This capability, when misused, can quickly give rise to
		programs that are <em>very difficult</em> to understand
		(and debug).
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Edsger Dijkstra</a>'s letter to the editor (of the <a href="http://www.acm.org">Communications of the ACM</a>): <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF">Goto Statement Considered Harmful</a>
	<li> Spaghetti code is the term commonly used to described the
		tangled mass of exeuction paths that can result from
		an undisciplined use of the goto statement. Such
		programs were difficult to understand and debug.
	<li> Structured programming and the corresponding structured
		control constructs were developed starting in the
		1960s, to ease the creation of correct and
		reliable programs.
	<li> For whatever reason, pasta dishes have become an
		accepted way of describing several basic programming
		paradigms. Several of them are
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code#Related_terms">described here</a>.
	</ol>
<li> Structured programming provides a
	single entry and a single exit point for a block of
	code. Forward jumps within the block, usually to the
	end, are often supported. However, jumps into the
	middle of a block of code, or "backward" jumps are
	not supported. 
<li> Test your understanding of the above by answering these
	<a href="../questions/questions_39.html">self-assessment questions</a>.
