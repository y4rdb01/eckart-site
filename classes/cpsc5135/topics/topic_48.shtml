	- Modeling and Simulation
</p>

<ol>
<li> Models are simplified descriptions of some real-world process.
<li> Describing models using a formalized system ensures that they are
	self-consistent (unambiguous) and facilitates discovery of
	gaps between the model and the real-world process it is
	intended to represent.
<li> Simplification makes the modeled process easier to understand
	and allow smaller versions to be created (either as computer
	programs or as physical implementations - often called
	scaled models) that can "run" the model (simulation).
<li> The results of simulations are used to predict what will
	happen in the real-world process. Sometimes this is done
	to avoid carrying out an actual (and often very expensive
	or time consuming) experiment (as in a new automobile or
	aircraft design) or to predict what will happen in a natural
	phenomenon over which we have limited control (such as
	weather forecasting).
<li> When real-world data corresponding to a simulation are available
	(as in weather forecasting), changes to the underlying model
	may be made to reduce the gap between simulation results and
	real-world observations. Note however, that there is often
	a point of diminishing returns. More complex models become
	less useful in helping to understand the real-world process
	and the tweaks to make the results gap smaller in some
	scenarios makes it larger in others.
<li> The best models are the ones that explain the vast majority of
	behavior across a wide variety of scenarios using the simplest
	descriptions (e.g., fewest rules).
<li> Examples:

	<li> <a href="http://www.wrf-model.org/index.php">Weather forecasting</a>
		- In 2015 NOAA used 13 kilometer wide cells to cover the
		Earth, with sizes of only 3 kilometers aroudn North America.

	<li> <a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ba09200l.html">Climate modeling</a>
		- In 2015 NASA used a grid resolution over the Earth of
		25 kilometers (simulating a period of 150 years).

<li> Simple models of complex dynamical systems can often give rise to
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_behavior">emergent behavior</a>.
	<ol>
	<li> Simple rules and local interactions
	<li> Give rise to <a href="http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/emergent-behavior">complex behavior</a> over time
	<li> One characteristic of emergent behavior is that the result after
		some large amout of time isn't possible to predict (often
		even at the qualitative level) without actually carrying
		out all of the actions that would occur over that time period.
	<li> Such systems are often extremely sensitive to their initial
		(or starting) conditions.
	<li> For example, life is an emergent property of physics (via
		chemistry).
	</ol>
<li> Listen to this marvelous <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/nicolas_perony_puppies_now_that_i_ve_got_your_attention_complexity_theory">TED talk</a>
	on modeling animal behaviors.
