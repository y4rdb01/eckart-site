	<strong>Dr. J Dana Eckart</strong>: Programming Languages (CPSC 5135)
	- Smalltalk Background

<ol>
<li> Created in the 1970s by the Learning Research Group (LRG) at
	Xerox PARC. Many well known advancements were developed at
	Xerox PARC, including the laser printer, Ethernet, the
	modern personal computer, graphical user interfaces, and
	many early advances in object-oriented programming.
<li> Is one of only a very few "pure" object-oriented programming
	languages. Java, C++, and Objective C are not "pure" since
	they include primitive types (which aren't class instances).
<li> Everything is an object (including classes) and all work
	is performed by sending messages to objects (including the
	definition of new classes). 
<li> Smalltalk was designed as a completely new programming language
	(though it borrows heavily from the ideas in Simula). It was
	(and still is) to be the language for all user interactions
	in the personal
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook">Dynabook</a>
	computer that
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a>
	envisioned in 1972. The Dynabook is arguably being realized
	in the XO tablets (X0-3 and X0-4) being created by the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child">One
	Laptop per Child</a> efforts, with which Dr. Kay is actively
	involved.
<li> Test your understanding of the above by answering these
	<a href="../questions/questions_29.html">self-assessment questions</a>.
