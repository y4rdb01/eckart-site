<li> Be sure to get the completed last page of the syllabus back to me by
	the end of the first week of class. If you can't get a physcial copy
	to me, you can capture, complete, "sign", and email it to me instead.

<li> Don't let <a href="../../../personal/poetry/the_wayfarer.shtml">this</a> happen to you!
<li> ... or <a href="../../common/I_Dont_Always.jpg">this</a>!
<li> <a href="https://colstate.view.usg.edu/">CourgarView</a>, the Learning
	Management System (LMS) used by the University System of Gerogia, will
	be used for:
	<ol>
	<li> submitting assignments (dropbox);
	<li> taking the weekly quizzes;
	<li> administering the tests and final exam; and
	<li> posting of the "raw" scores for graded materials
		(e.g., assignments, projects, and tests).
	</ol>
<li> Please remember that plagiarism (including copied program code) is a
	violation of the academic dishonesty policy. Links explaining what
	plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found at the end of
	<a href="https://cs.columbusstate.edu/resources/academic-dishonesty-policy.php">

<li> <a href="../../common/assignments.shtml">Concerning Assignments</a>
<li> Do <strong>NOT</strong> collaborate on assignments. While this seems
	unnecessarily restrictive at first, the following are my reasons
	(which my experiences have repeatedly confirmed):
	<ol>
	<li> I won't know anyone is having difficulty with the assignment
		if everyone in class is talking to each other and no one
		bothers to come to me with questions.
	<li> The other people you ask may know less about the assignment than
		you do. Even something as simple as what the assignment is
		asking for can be understood differently by different people.
		If you have questions, then the instructor (who, after all,
		created the assignment) will best understand the intent of
		the assignment and will be better prepared to help you along.
	<li> Collaboration can be a slippery slope, and discussing solution
		approaches can lead to extremely similar code (depending on
		how extensive the discussions were) that gives the appearance
		of copying - a violation of the Academic Integrity policy.
	<li> The graded assignments are part of how your understanding of the
		material is evaluated, and must therefore be your own work.
		When you collaborate too closely with others, the evaluation
		becomes that of many people's understanding of the material
		and not just your own understanding.
	</ol>
<li> In order to get the most benefit from the class notes and recorded
	lectures, I suggest printing out the class notes and then watch the
	videos, hand writting notes on the printed class notes. Based on
	<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/to-remember-a-lecture-better-take-notes-by-hand/361478/">research</a>
	(<a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/22/0956797614524581.abstract">abstract</a>),
	this should better help you remember the material.
<li> Regarding the weekly quizzes, I <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you
	to use them as a study aid. In particular, read through the associated
	sections of the textbook first, then take the quiz while reading through
	the lecture notes for that week (and listening to the videos). After
	doing this, you will be very familiar with the material and should be
	able to ask specific questions in class concerning those elements you
	found difficult to understand. Also, please note that many of the
	quiz questions are multiple response - <em>so you need to select all
	of the correct answers to get full credit</em>.
<li> Based on the experience of past students, you should expect to devote
	at least 12 hours (including class time, working on the self
	assessment questions, assignments, studying for tests, etc) of time
	each week to this class in order to be successful. This is a minimum
	time investment - some students may find that they must spend more
	time per week in order to master the material.
<li> Finally, please note that the detailed lecture notes in combination with
	the self assessment questions constitute the "study guide" for this
	course and the tests. If you need something in a different
	style, format, or with different levels of detail, please feel free
	to cut and paste from these materials to fashion the study guide
	that fits your particular needs.
