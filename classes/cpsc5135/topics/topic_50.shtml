<ol>
<li> Discrete time, discrete space, fixed interaction rules
	<ol>
	<li> Cells are represented as a regular N-dimensional
		tesselation (grid) of "squares" with the edges
		often wrapped around to the opposing side. Thus
		a 2-dimensional CA would form a torus (doughnut).
	<li> Time progresses in a sequence of unary time steps.
	<li> Each cell has a (usually small) set of state variables
		that represent a finite set of states that the
		cell can possess.
	<li> A (usually small) set of rules maps the current state
		of each cell, along with the current state of a set
		of neighboring cells within some fixed and finite
		(again, usually small) distance, into the next state
		for this cell.
	<li> All cells carry out their rules (which can differ from
		one another, but normally are the same) in order to
		calculate what their values will be in the next time
		step.
	<li> Finally, once all cells have completed their calculations
		they update their states simultaneously before
		beginning the next time step.
	</ol>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>
	<ol>
	<li> Uses a rectanguilar 2-dimensional grid
	<li> Each cell has two states: alive and dead
	<li> A cell has 8 neighbors that "touch" the cell at each of
		the corresponding compass directions: N, S, E, W,
		NE, SE, SW, NW.
	<li> Rules:
		<ol>
		<li> Live cells with less than 2 live neighbors die
			(of loneliness).
		<li> Live cells with more than 3 neighbros die (from
			overcrowding).
		<li> Live cells with 2 or 3 live nieghbors remain
			alive (healthy).
		<li> Dead cells with 3 live neighbors become alive
			(birth).
		<li> All other cells retain their previous state.
		</ol>
	<li> Example of emergent behavior: <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Gun">Gosper glider gun</a><br/>

	<li> Classes of Cellular Automata (when nearly all initial patterns)
		<ol>
		<li> Class 1: Quickly settle into a stable homogeneous state.
			Any randomness in the initial conditions disappears.
			[Boring]
		<li> Class 2: Quickly settle into stable or short-period
			oscillating structures. Some initial randomness
			remains but its impact on the final pattern tends
			to be localized.  [Repetitous]
		<li> Class 3: Give rise to pseudo-random or chaotic
			behavior. Any stable structures that emerge
			are local in both time and space and are
			quickly destroyed by the surrounding noise
			(pseudo-randomness). Local changes in the
			initial pattern tend to propagate globally.
			[Random]
		<li> Class 4: Give rise to interesting and complex
			behaviors that are neither random nor simple
			short-period oscillators.
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>
			has postulated that many (and perhaps all)
			class 4 CA are
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete">Turing Complete</a>.
			[Self-Organizing]

<li> Test your understanding of the above by answering these
	<a href="../questions/questions_50.html">self-assessment questions</a>.
