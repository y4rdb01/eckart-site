<ol>
<li> Pandemic (as a class exercise)
	<ol>
	<li> Each patch has a different population density, and
		thus contact rate between individuals, impacting
		disease transmission.
	<li> There is an incubation period before an infected
		person is contagious. The incubation period has
		a minimum value, but thereafter there's a fixed
		chance of becoming contagious.
	<li> There is a period of time before symptoms become
		apparent. If this time is greater than the incubation
		period, the difference is when the risk of disease
		spread is the greatest.
	<li> There is a fixed illness recovery chance for infected
		patches.
	<li> For each time step, there is a pre-set chance that a
		patch will become infected by a neighbor. The chance
		is 0 during the incubation period, greatest between
		contagious and symptom outbreak, and half the greatest
		value once symptoms emerge.
	<li> For each time step during which a patch is infected and
		exhibits symptoms, there is a small but fixed chance
		of death in its population.
	<li> Once a patch has been sick and recovered, it is considered
		immune from further outbreaks.
