	- Discrete vs Continuous
</p>

<ol>
<li> Time: Discrete time models/simulations look at either events
	(typically interactions between model elements) or fixed
	time intervals. Discrete event simulations determine when
	the next interaction will occur and then update everything
	to represent the model's state at that time. Fixed time
	intervals are exactly that, the simulation progresses from
	one time to the next using a fixed increment (e.g., seconds,
	minutes, hours, days, years).
<li> Space: Divides the physical aspects of the model into areas (or
	volumes) of fixed size. The spatial units may be quite large
	with repsect to the entities they might contain, however all
	that is known is that an entity resides in a spatial unit at
	a certain time (but not exactly where within the spatial unit).
<li> False Dichotomy: Ultimately (von Neumann) computers are discrete
	machines with finite resources, so all simulations are
	ultiamtely discrete in nature. As the time (and spatial)
	units get smaller, we more closely approximate a continuous
	perspective.
<li> Adaptive Techniques: Adjusting the time and spatial sizes
	to reduce the error on an as needed basis is a great way
	to bridge the gap as well as clearly see discrete vs
	continuous as a difference in degree rather than as a binary
	choice. A common technique is to calculate the model values
	based on the current choice (e.g., time interval) and then
	to divide it into half and calculate over each half interval.
	If the result over the two half intervals differs from 
	that over the interval taken as a whole by a certain amount
	(either fixed or on a percentage basis), then the interval
	is halved (and the technique is applied recursively). Whether
	or not such adaptive techniques are reasonable/possible
	often depends upon the nature of the model.
