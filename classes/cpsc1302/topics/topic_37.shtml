	- Throwing Exceptions
</p>

<ol>
<li> Exceptions are created (thrown) when either the Java language system
	(or your program) recognizes that something has gone wrong.
<li> Exceptions correspond to unusual, uncommon, and generally unexpected
	situations that can occur during the exeuction of a program. Examples
	of such situations are:
	<ol>
	<li> Division by 0 (zero).
	<li> Results of arithmetic operations are too large to store.
	<li> Unexpected input error (note that reaching the end of a file is
		not unusual and unexpected in and of itself).
	<li> An indicated/chosen file wasn't found.
	<li> An output error occurred (e.g., the disk was full, file was too large).
	<li> Part of the program (e.g., a class file) couldn't be located.
	<li> The program has run out of memory and can't continue processing.
	</ol>
<li> Exceptions are created by a "throw" statement:
<pre><code>
	if (checkingAccount.balance() < 0) {
		throw new Exception("OMG, what happened?!?");
	}
</code></pre>
	Note that exceptions are instances of classes (i.e., objects), which
	can carry information with them about the nature and cause of the
	error that prompted the exception.
</ol>
