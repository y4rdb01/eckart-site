<li> Be sure to get the completed last page of the syllabus back to me by
	the end of the first week of class. If you can't get a physcial copy
	to me, you can capture, complete, "sign", and email it to me instead.

<li> <a href="https://colstate.view.usg.edu/">CourgarView</a>, the Learning
	Management System (LMS) used by the University System of Gerogia, will
	be used <em>only</em> for posting of the "raw" scores for graded
	materials (e.g., assignments, projects, and tests).
<li> Please remember that plagiarism (including copied program code) is a
	violation of the academic dishonesty policy. Links explaining what
	plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found at the end of
	<a href="https://cs.columbusstate.edu/resources/academic-dishonesty-policy.php">

<li> As indicated in the syllabus, there are no graded assignments for this
	course, however, you should complete all of the self assessment
	questions as tests will be composed of one or more of these
	problems. I <em>encourage</em> you to <em>work together</em>
	on the self assessment problems to gain practice with Java and to
	learn from others in the class.
<li> In order to get the most benefit from the class notes, I suggest printing
	out the class notes and hand writing annotations on the hard copy
	during lectures. Based on
	<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/to-remember-a-lecture-better-take-notes-by-hand/361478/">research</a>
	(<a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/22/0956797614524581.abstract">abstract</a>),
	this should better help you remember the material.
<li> Based on the experience of past students, you should expect to devote
	at least 25 hours (including class time, working on the self
	assessment questions, studying for tests, etc) of time each week to
	this class in order to be successful. This is a minimum time
	investment - some students may find that they must spend more time
	per week in order to master the material.
<li> Finally, please note that the detailed lecture notes in combination with
	the self assessment questions constitute the "study guide" for this
	course and the tests. If you need something in a different
	style, format, or with different levels of detail, please feel free
	to cut and paste from these materials to fashion the study guide
	that fits your particular needs.
