	- Vehicle Example
</p>

<ol>
<li> While perhaps not as obvious as the biology taxonomy, vehicles also
	have a taxonomy that we tend to use (even if we don't write it down
	in a formal way).
<li> Define a set of Java classes for the following, extending the appropriate
	ones to achieve the hierarchy relationships commonly used. Note that
	the following are mixed up a bit, so you should probably read through
	the list first before starting to write any class definitions.
	<ol>
	<li> Submarine
	<li> Truck
	<li> Spacecraft
	<li> Airplane
	<li> Quadracycle
	<li> Helicopter
	<li> Boeing747
	<li> Aircraft
	<li> Watercraft
	<li> SurfaceVessel
	<li> Car
	<li> Destroyer
	<li> Vehicle
	<li> SpaceShuttle
	<li> Landcraft
	<li> Soyuz
	<li> Bicycle
	<li> Blimp
	</ol>
<li> Create an "identify" method as we did with the <em>Animal</em> example
	and override it as appropriate in any other classes that need it.
<li> Write "main" method inside a <em>Driver</em> class that creates an
	instance of each class and prints out its identification.
<li> Create a "primaryCharacteristic" method that returns a <em>String</em>
	which is describes the most distinguishing characteristic of that
	type of vehicle (e.g., "travels underwater"). If you cannot think
	of one, then return an empty <em>String</em>.
<li> Adjust the "main" method to print out both the identification and the
	corresponding distinguishing characteristic.
<li> Add 2 new types of vehicles, your choice, and update your "main" method
	to create instances of these new vehicles and print out their
	identification and corresponding distinguishing characteristics.
</ol>
