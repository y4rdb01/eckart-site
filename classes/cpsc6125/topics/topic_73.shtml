<li> <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf">NIST's 5 essential characteristics</a> of Cloud computing:
	<ol>
	<li> On-demand self-service
		<blockquote>
		Consumers can automatically provision computing resources as
		needed without human interaction from each service provider. 
		</blockquote>
	<li> Broad network access
		<blockquote>
		Services are available over the network and accessed via
		standard mechanisms and protocols.
		</blockquote>
	<li> Resource pooling
		<blockquote>
		Computing resources (e.g., CPU, memory, network) are pooled by
		the provider to serve multiple tenants, with different
		physical and virtual resources dynamically (re)assigned
		according to consumer demand.
		</blockquote>
	<li> Rapid elasticity
		<blockquote>
		Capabilities can be automatically provisioned and released to
		rapidly adapt to demand. These capabilities often appear
		unlimited to the consumer.
		</blockquote>
	<li> Measured service
		<blockquote>
		Cloud systems resource usage is automatically monitored,
		controlled, and reported, providing transparency to both the
		provider and Cloud service consumer.
		</blockquote>
	</ol>
<li> <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf">NIST's 4 Cloud deployment models</a>:
	<ol>
	<li> Private cloud
		<blockquote>
		The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by
		a single organization. It may be owned, managed, and
		operated by the organization, a third party, or some
		combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
		</blockquote>
	<li> Community cloud
		<blockquote>
		The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a
		specific community of consumers from organizations that have
		shared concerns. It may be owned, managed, and operated by one
		or more of the organizations in the community, a third party,
		or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off
		premises.
		</blockquote>
	<li> Public cloud
		<blockquote>
		The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the
		general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by one
		or more organizations and exists on the premises of one or
		more of these organizations.
		</blockquote>
	<li> Hybrid cloud
		<blockquote>
		The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more
		distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public)
		that are bound together by standardized or proprietary
		technology that enables data and application portability
		(e.g., load balancing between clouds, or enabling unmet needs
		on a private cloud to be satisfied by a public cloud through
		prior arrangement).
		</blockquote>
	</ol>
<li> Virtualization has enabled the modern commercialization of clouds by
	allowing multiple tenats (via VMs and their guest OS) to share a
	single computing system while preventing them from accessing each
	others data or resources (or even knowing about the existence of
	other VMs).
	<ol>
	<li> Remote server hosting was available prior to clouds, but required
		the rental/ownership of an entire computer. Since the acquired
		computing capacity needed to be sized for the (expected) worst
		case, there was often plenty of headroom available.
	<li> The acquistion of this extra headroom represented extra cost to
		the customer. Furthermore, it represented lost opportunity
		to the vendor, since the excess capacity (underutilized
		headroom) could be sold to other customers.
	<li> Virtualization enables lower pricing to customers, since they
		pay only for the computing power and storage that they use.
		Vendors can oversell their physical hardware capacity, knowing
		that the full capacity will (almost) never be needed by all
		of its customers simultaneously.
	</ol>
<li> VM migration
	<ol>
	<li> In traditional (non-virtualized) computing, migrating an OS and
		its software from one computer to another took significant
		time (halt the old system, copy/move disk, transfer network
		connections, restart the new system).
	<li> Relocating a VM is easier. The VM can be paused (rather than
		shutdown) since it's really just a process, the files and
		process information moved (which may be nearly trivial if
		the storage is non-local, e.g., via NFS), and the VM process
		resumed on the new hypervisor.
	<li> <em>Live migration</em> of VMs can occur by copying the files and
		memory pages of a VM while it is still running (known as
		<em>pre-copy memory migration</em>). Some memory pages will
		be written (dirty) in the mean time, but most won't be. At
		some point only a small number of dirty pages will remain,
		then the VM can be paused for a VERY short time while the
		remaining memory pages are copied before the VM is resumed
		on a new physical computing system.
	<li> If the VM down-time is not noticable (to the customer) this is
		called <em>seamless live migration</em>.
	</ol>
