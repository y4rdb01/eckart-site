<li> Bell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics, but
	not the aims, slowly pulled out of the project. Their last
	researchers to leave Multics, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie,
	Doug McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna, decided to redo the work on a
	much smaller scale.
<li> In 1969, on a little used PDP-7 at Bell Labs, a team of Bell Labs
	researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie developed a
	hierarchical file system, the concepts of computer processes
	and device files, a command-line interpreter, and some small
	utility programs.
<li> In 1970, Peter Neumann coined the project name UNICS (UNiplexed
	Information and Computing Service) as a pun on Multics
	(Multiplexed Information and Computer Services): the new
	operating system was an emasculated Multics.
<li> When the Computer Science Research Group at Bell Labs wanted to
	use Unix on a machine much larger than the PDP-7, Thompson
	and Ritchie traded the promise of adding text processing
	for a PDP-11/20 machine.
<li> In 1970, the Unix operating system was officially named and ran
	on the PDP-11/20. A text formatting program called roff and
	a text editor were added. All three were written in PDP-11/20
	assembly language.
<li> The UNIX Programmer's Manual was published on 3 November 1971.
<li> The first commercial instance of Unix worldwide was installed in
	early 1972 at New York Telephone Co. Systems Development Center.
<li> In 1972, Unix was rewritten in the C programming language.
	resulting in a much more portable system, requiring only a
	relatively small amount of machine-dependent code to be
	replaced when porting Unix to other computing platforms.
<li> Under a 1956 consent decree in settlement of an antitrust case,
	AT&T (the parent organization of Bell Labs) was forbidden from
	entering the computer business. Unix could not, therefore, be
	turned into a product but, under the terms of the decree,
	Bell Labs was required to license its non-telephone technology
	to anyone that asked.
<li> AT&T made Unix available to universities and commercial firms,
	as well as the United States government, under licenses. The
	licenses included all source code including the
	machine-dependent parts of the kernel, which were written
	in PDP-11 assembly language.
<li> Versions of the Unix system were determined by editions of its
	user manuals. Versions 4, 5, and 6 were released by 1975,
	adding the concept of pipes, which led to the development
	of a more modular code base, and quicker development cycles.
<li> The University of California at Berkeley was one licensee.
	The first Unix system at Berkeley was a PDP-11 installed in
	1974, and the computer science department used it for
	extensive research thereafter.
<li> In 1977 Bill Joy (and a later cofounder of SUN Microsystems),
	then a graduate student at Berkeley, started compiling the
	first Berkeley Software Distribution (1BSD), which was
	released on March 9, 1978.
<li> The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD, sometimes called Berkeley
	Unix) was developed and distributed from 1977 to 1995.
<li> Many contributions to Unix first appeared in BSD releases,
	notably the C shell with job control and the addition of
	TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel. The
	accompanying Berkeley sockets API is a de facto standard for
	networking APIs and has been copied on many platforms.
<li> SunOS is released in 1983 for SUN Microsystems computers (based
	on BSD with thanks to Bill Joy).
<li> The GNU (a recursive acronym meaning "GNU's not Unix") Project
	was founded in 1983 by Richard Stallman to develop a free
	(as in freedom) computing software stack based on Unix.
<li>  In 1984, several companies established the X/Open consortium
	with the goal of creating an open system specification based
	on UNIX. Despite early progress, the standardization effort
	collapsed into the "Unix wars", with various companies forming
	rival standardization groups. The most successful Unix-related
	standard turned out to be the IEEE's POSIX specification,
	published in 1988 and soon mandated by the United States
	government for many of its own systems.
<li> MINIX (mini-Unix), created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, is released
	in 1987 as an independent Unix-like system designed to run on
	IBM PCs. It is a rewrite of Unix to avoid copyright and
	trademark problems with AT&T.
<li> In April 1991, Linus Torvalds begins writing Linux as an
	improvement over MINIX.
<li> The Linux kernel is released in 1992 under the GNU license,
	it has grown to become a full-featured and stable Unix OS.
<li> Carnegie Mellon University released the Mach kernel in 1985, which
	is the basis for FreeBSD, released in 1993, and Mac OS X,
	released in 1999 (based on NeXTSTEP released in 1989).
<li> Android, based on the Linux kernel, is released by Google in 2008.
