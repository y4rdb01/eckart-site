	<strong>Dr. J Dana Eckart</strong>: Advanced Operating Systems (CPSC 6125)
	- Hypervisors

<ol>
<li> Type 1 Hypervisor
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor"><img style="float: right" src="/eckart/classes/cpsc3125/topics/content/HypervisorTypes.png" width="402" height="251" img="Types of Hypervisors"/></a>
	<ol>
	<li> Runs directly on the physical hardware.
	<li> Provides "copies" of the physical hardware (virtual machines)
		each of which can run an OS.
	<li> By having to support complete copies of the hardware, a type 1
		hypervisor must also provide (at least for itself) many OS
		services (e.g., rudimentary file system, process scheduling).
	<li> More of the CPU cycles are used for running the VMs, their
		corresponding OS, and associated user processes than is the
		case for a type 2 hypervisor since there's one less layer of
		implemented abstraction (making it more efficient).
	</ol>
<li> Type 2 Hypervisor
	<ol>
	<li> Runs within another OS (the <em>host operating system</em>) which
		may or may not be running directly on the physical hardware.
	<li> Also known as a <em>hosted hypervisor</em> since it runs on a
		host operating system.
	<li> Relies on the underlying OS (in which the hypervisor is running)
		to help provide some services (e.g., allocate and schedule
		resources, file systems).
	<li> Because a type 2 hypervisor runs within an OS, its implementation
		can be simpler than that of a type 1 hypervisor since the
		host OS provides a file system, scheduleing, and other
		services upon which it can build.
	<li> Is less efficient than a type 1 hypervisor since there is an
		extra implementation layer (the host OS) providing the
		abstraction on which the hypervisor runs.
	</ol>
<li> Both types of hypervisors must execute the instructions on their
	virtual machines in a <em>safe</em> manner.
<li> The OS running in a virtual machine is called a <em>guest operating
	system</em>.
<li> Try installing and running a type 2 hypervisor:
	<ol>
	<li> Download a free ".iso" (disk image) file for
		<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu
		Desktop</a> to install on the virtual machine you'll create.
	<li> Microsoft's Hyper-V
		<ol>
		<li> Professional and Enterprise Editions of Windows 8, 8.1,
			and 10 support Hyper-V on VT architectures.
		<li> Use <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/196158/how-to-create-and-run-virtual-machines-with-hyper-v/">these instructions</a>
			to install and run Hyper-V.
		</ol>
	<li> VMware Workstation Pro
		<ol>
		<li> Works on both Windows and Linux host operating systems.
		<li> Downlaod a trail copy of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/workstation-evaluation.html">VMware Workstation Pro</a>.
		<li> Use <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-VMware-Workstation">these
			instructions</a> to install and run VMware Workstation.
		</ol>
	<li> VirtualBox
		<ol>
		<li> Runs on a wider variety of operating systems, in case
			you don't have access to Windows (for Hyper-V) or you
			have an older version of Windows.
		<li> Download and install the
			<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox software</a>.
		<li> You might want to check out this
			<a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/16/getting-hacked-doesnt-bad/">detailed tutorial</a>
			to help you get started.
		</ol>
	</ol>
