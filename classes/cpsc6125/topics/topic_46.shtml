	- Dates and Time
</p>

<ol>
<li> The popular way of designating dates (in the US) is ambiguous.
	The date 10/11/12 can mean:
	<ol>
	<li> 11 October 2012 (and the year could be many different
		centuries, e.g., 1912). 
	<li> 10 November 2012
	<li> 12 Novemeber 2010
	<li> ...
	</ol>
<li> There is a wide variety of
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country">date formats around the world</a>,
	making unambiguous dates difficult to achieve.
	<a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/map-mondays-wtf-is-wrong-with-canada-s-time">This article</a>
	shows a map of what many countries use, and some countries even
	use multiple formats!
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_the_United_States#Time">The US is also one of the few countries that uses a
	12 hour clock almost exclusively</a>. This leads to confusion
	about what time 12:00 is. While "noon" and "midnight" help, in
	common use there is still confusion about whether midnight
	of 1 Jan 1980 is at the beginning of that day, or the
	end. The use of a 24-hour clock removes the ambiguity.
	<ol>
	<li> 12:00am = midnight = 0:00
	<li> 12:00pm = noon = 12:00
	</ol>
<li> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a>
	date (and time) format
	<ol>
	<li> Based on the Gregorian calendar.
	<li> Given in significant order (with zero padded months and days).
	<li> E.g., Albert Einstein's birthdate is: 1879-03-14
	<li> The use of hyphens reduces ambiguity so that dates like
		20101220 aren't miinterpreted as 20 Nov 1220 (thinking
		the original was in little endian format, DDMMYYYY).
	<li> Time uses zero padded hours, minutes, and seconds. E.g., 16:05:00
		(for 4:05pm)
	<li> Using ISO 8601 date/time formats:
		<ol>
		<li> As version indications on documents is preferrable to
			ordinal numbering since the "effective" date is
			immediately obvious.
		<li> As part of file and/or directory names makes it easy to
			see multiple file versions, and sorting provides easy
			access to the earliest and latest versions. 
		</ol>
	</ol>
<li> Julian Dates
	<ol>
	<li> Some draw backs of the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> are:
		<ol>
		<li> It is difficult to determine how many days
			have elapsed between two dates.
			<ol>
			<li> It's not a simple subtraction since months have
				different numbers of days.
			<li> The month of February has an additional day in
				leap years (a year is a leap year if it is
				divisable by 4, unless it is divisable by 100,
				unless it is divisable by 400).
			<li> The switch to the Gregorian calendar (from
				the preceeding Julian calendar).
				<ol>
				<li> In predominatly Catholic countries
					Thursday, 4 October 1582 (Julian
					calendar) was followed by
					Friday, 15 October 1582
					(Gregorian calendar).
				<li> Some (predominatly Protestant)
					countries didn't officially
					adopt the Gregorian calendar
					until the early-1750s.
				</ol>
			</ol>
		<li> Unless care is taken to indicate the calendar
			being used, dates between 1580 and 1755 can
			be off by as much as 11 days.
		</ol>
	<li> The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius
		Caesar in 46 BCE. Whereas Julian periods (used to
		count years) were proposed by Joseph Scaliger in 1583,
		and the counting of days since the first year of the
		Julian period, proposed by John Herschel in 1849.
	<li> Julian dates count the number of days since its epoch
		(noon on 1 Jan 4713 BCE in the Julian calendar is the
		start of day 0) and are counted relative to
		Terrestrial Time (TT) at the meridian of Greenwich
		[similar to UTC but not adjusted
		for the Earth's varied rotation rate].
	<li> Julian dates are used by astronomers, which is why the
		date changes at noon (the beginning of the
		astronomical day). Furthermore, the time of the
		date is shown as a fractional day (e.g., 8:06am on
		1 Jan 2013 CE would be denoted as 2,456,293.8375).
