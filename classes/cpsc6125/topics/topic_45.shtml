<ol>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_drift">Clock drift</a>
	<ol>
	<li> No clock keeps perfect time (not even the best atomic clocks).
	<li> Imperfections in electronics, materials (e.g., crystals), the
		mechanism, and even the environment can introduce inaccuracies
		in time keeping that cause clock ticks/vibrations to vary. 
	<li> Most computers use crystal based clocks, the best of which are
		accurate to only about 2 ppm (about 1 minute per year). More
		expensive (and climate controlled) quartz oscillators can
		be 1000+ times more accurate - up to 1 ppb).
	<li> So even if two separate clocks start off perfectly synchronized,
		over time, they will differ by an increasing amount (called
		<em>clock skew</em>).
	<li> To reduce the effects of clock skew, clocks are regularly
		synchronized.
	</ol>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">General Relativity</a>
	<ol>
	<li> Describes clocks in different inertial frames that are subject to
		acceleration (Special Relativity applies only to inertial
		frames with NO acceleration).
	<li> Clocks experiencing greater acceleration (or that reside in larger
		gravitational fields) will appear to run more slowly to
		observers in inertial frames with less acceleration (or
		weaker gravity fields).
	<li> Such effects turn out to be significant for GPS navigation, as
		the atomic clocks residing on the GPS satellites in orbit run
		faster when compared to clocks on the Earth's surface.
	<li> If General Relativity were ignored, GPS locations would be off
		by about 10 kilometers after only one day.
	<li> Thus having <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/11/03/361069820/new-clock-may-end-time-as-we-know-it?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=202503">ever more accurate clocks</a>
		doesn't really solve the problem.
	</ol>
<li> Time as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">POSET</a>
	<ol>
	<li> There is no such thing as absolute time, all times are relative
		to one another in their different inertial frames.
	<li> Only when there are interactions between different time "domains"
		can the order of events be compared.
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytree">Polytrees</a>
		 are types of POSETs.

	</ol>
<li> Distributed clocks
	<ol>
	<li> Don't provide a <em>physical clock</em> (which
		corresponds to "real" time), but instead provide
		a <em>logical clock</em> that can be used to order events.
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps">Lamport timestamps</a>
		<ol>
		<li> Provides a logical clock that enables a partial ordering
			of events (based on interactions).
		<li> Algorithm:
			<ol>
			<li> Each process (computer) maintains a counter/clock
				that starts at zero.
			<li> The counter/clock is incremented before each
				"event".
			<li> When a process (computer) sends a message, the
				value of the counter/clock is included as
				part of the message.
			<li> The receiving process (computer) sets its
				counter/clock to one more (+1) than the
				greater of its counter/clock and the
				counter/clock value in the message.
			</ol>
		<li> If event <em>a</em> happened-before event <em>b</em>
			then the counter/clock associated with event
			<em>a</em> will be less than that for event <em>b</em>.
		<li> However, the reverse is <strong>not</strong> true,
			that is if <em>a</em>'s counter/clock is less than
			<em>b</em>'s, does NOT imply that <em>a</em>
			happened-before <em>b</em>.
		</ol>
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">Vector clock</a>
		<ol>
		<li> Maintains a logical clock for a system of N processes.
		<li> The Vector clock (for N processes) is an array of N
			logical clocks (one for each process).
		<li> Algorithm:
			<ol>
			<li> All logical clocks in the vector start at zero.
			<li> When a process has an internal event, it
				increments (+1) its own logical clock
				in the vector.
			<li> When a message is sent, the entire vector of
				logical clocks is sent with the message.
			<li> When a process receives a message, it increments
				(+1) its own logical clock in its vector,
				and replaces any elements in its vector with
				the corresponding values from the received
				vector if they are larger.
			</ol>
		<li> Given two vector clock values <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>
			<ol>
			<li> <em>X</em> happend-before (and is NOT
				concurrent with) <em>Y</em> if each
				element in the vector for <em>X</em>
				is less than or equal to the
				corresponding element in <em>Y</em>.
			<li> If some of the corresponding elements of <em>X</em>
				are less than those in <em>Y</em>, and others
				are greater, then the two events are
				concurrent.
			</ol>
		<li> Unlike Lamport timestamps, Vector clocks can infer if
			one event happened-before another event based on
			their clock (vector) values.
		</ol>
	<li> Here's <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/417/notes/clocks">another description</a>
		of these two clocks that includes some descriptive pictures
		and code.
	</ol>
