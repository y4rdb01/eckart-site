	<strong>Dr. J Dana Eckart</strong>: Operating Systems (CPSC 3125)
	- Insider Attacks
</p>

<ol>
<li> Insider attacks differ from other attacks in that the attacker has
	specialized knowledge of, and access to, the environment.
<li> Logic Bombs
	<ol>
	<li> While these may "explode" after the person has left the company,
		they are implemented while they are still an employee (and
		are generally intended either as insurance against being
		unemployed, or revenge at having been "let go"). 
	<li> A program is designed to create havoc either:
		<ol>
		<li> at a particular pre-programmed time (time bombs);
		<li> when it fails to receive a heartbeat
			(i.e., a deadman switch), probably in the form of
			an entered password; or
		<li> upon the occurrence of an observable event (e.g., the
			employee's name fails to appear in the payroll).
		</ol>
	<li> A bomb's actions can take many forms:
		<ol>
		<li> Removal of (or changes to) random files;
		<li> Subtle changes in important programs;
		<li> Encryption of key data (often for purposes of
			extortion).
		</ol>
	<li> If revenge is the goal, insider knowledge can enable random
		changes to data over a period of time so the "good data"
		on backups will slowly be replaced. It may be possible that
		the issue won't be discovered until the backups contain
		a significant amount of the corrupted data, making an
		effective recovery nearly impossible. NOTE: This is another
		excellent reason why keeping backups for a longer period of
		time is crucial.
	</ol>
<li> Back Doors
	<ol>
	<li> Most often this takes the form of a special login that is
		checked separately from normal processing - thus ensuring
		that those that know about it can always gain access to the
		system.
	<li> This doesn't have to be a login, it can also take the form of
		special commands that enable access above and beyond what
		would normally be available.
	<li> In a more subtle way, back doors can take the form of
		intentionally introduced software weaknesses (bugs).
		<ol>
		<li> Such bugs could be exploited using the techniques discussed
			in the <a href="/eckart/classes/cpsc3125/topics/topic_57.shtml">previous topic</a>.
		<li> These bugs can be <em>extremely</em> subtle. The
			introduction of a weakness in a
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG">random bit generator</a>
			by the NSA is an excellent example.
		</ol>
	</ol>
<li> Spoofing
	<ol>
	<li> Unlike a back door attack, spoofing often doesn't require any
		special privileges or access.
	<li> Login spoofing involves an ordinary user creating a program that
		looks just like the normal login screen:
		<ol>
		<li> The program prompts for the logname and password
			(remembering them for later use); and
		<li> Then the program kills itself, starting the REAL login
			screen. The user thinks they made a typo and logs in
			again, none the wiser.
		</ol>
	<li> Web browser pop-ups can spoof a system message about having
		found a problem (e.g., virus).
		<ol>
		<li> Such messages often seem to be about selling you a
			product, but it doesn't really have to stop there and
			clicking them can download malicious software (more
			often as part of a trojan horse attack).
		<li> While a reasonable inspection can often thwart such
			attempts, enough people are either caught off-guard or
			cannot discern the differene that such attacks are
			successful.
		</ol>
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">Phishing</a>
		attacks (often via email, but can also occur via voice
		calls, texts, etc) are an attempt to glean information from
		someone by pretending that the sender is a legitimate
		representative of an organization that the
		receiver does business with. Phishing attacks on social
		networks can have success rates as high as 70%.
	<li> Spoof attacks (particularly phishing attacks) are some of the
		most difficult to defend against.
		<ol>
		<li> User education is currently the best general defense; but
		<li> Socially based spoofs prey upon our desire to help other
			people, and people are often the weakest link in any
			security system.
		</ol>
	</ol>
<li> Defending against insider attacks generally requires a
	organizational/social solution:
	<ol>
	<li> Separation of duties - so that one person doesn't have control
		over too much (enabling them to pull off the attack by
		themselves).
	<li> Code reviews - with more eyes on what's being done, it's harder
		to sneak in an obvious problem.
	<li> Rotation of personel - makes it harder to collude with someone
		else to accomplish an attack if an attacker is never certain
		who they might be working with (or depending on).
	</ol>
<li> Test your understanding of the above by answering these
	<a href="/eckart/classes/cpsc3125/questions/questions_58.html">self-assessment questions</a>.
</ol>
