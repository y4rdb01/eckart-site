</ol>


<h2>COURSE ASSESSMENT</h2>
<p>
There are three (3) exams scheduled during the semester: two (2) in-class
exams and a final exam.  Each exam is cumulative, so any previously covered
material is fair game. All exams are closed book, closed notes, closed
neighbor, with no use of laptops, tablets, calculators, phones, or
other electronic devices.  Furthermore, you should not discuss your exam
with anyone until the instructor has handed the graded exams back to you
(usually within 1 or 2 class meetings) as some people may not have completed
the exam yet.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the exams, there will be weekly on-line quizzes (except for the
first and last weeks of class, as well as Spring break week) to be completed by
the time and day indicated in the class schedule. Each quiz is composed of the
study questions corresponding to the topics on the schedule for that week. You
will have up to 4 hours to complete these quizzes (though you shouldn't need
this much time). You may use your book, the published notes for this class,
internet resources, and course related software (e.g., the C compiler).
However, you may <strong>not</strong> consult any other materials (or persons)
while completing the quizzes.
</p>

<p>
The final course average is a composite of the exams, the weekly quizzes,
and the programming assignments.  The relative weighting of these items is:

<table style="text-align: center; margin: auto">
	<tr>
		<th>Assessment Tool</th> <th>Weighting</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4 Programming Assignments</td> <td>10% each</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Weekly Quizzes (averaged together)</td> <td>15% total</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2 In-Class Tests</td> <td>15% each</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Final Exam</td> <td>15%</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Since the final exam is cumulative over the entire course, your score on the
final exam will be used to replace any of your grades for the in-class exams
that are lower than your final exam score. In other words, your average for
all of the exams will be no less than your final exam score.
</p>

<p>
Course letter grades are determined by the final course average according
to the following chart: 

<table style="text-align: center; margin: auto">
<tr><th>Letter<br/>Grade</th><th style="vertical-align: bottom">Average</th></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>average >= 87</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>73 <= average < 87</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>59 <= average < 73</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>45 <= average < 59</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>average < 45</td></tr>
</table>

</p>

<h3>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h3>
<p>
All students are expected to recognize and uphold standards of intellectual and
academic integrity. As a basic and minimum standard of conduct in academic
matters that students be honest and that they submit for credit only the
products of their own efforts. Both the ideals of scholarship and the need for
fairness require that all dishonest work be rejected as a basis for academic
credit. They also require that students refrain from any and all forms of
dishonorable or unethical conduct related to their academic work.
</p>

<p>
Students are expected to comply with the provisions of Section III, "Student
Responsibilities," of the Columbus State University Student Handbook.  This
specifically includes the sections on "Academic Irregularity," and "Conduct
Irregularity."  In particular, the Columbus State University Student Handbook
states:
	<blockquote>
	"No student shall give or receive assistance in the preparation of any
	assignment, essay, laboratory report, or examination to be submitted as
	a requirement for any academic course in such a way that the submitted
	work can no longer be considered the personal effort of the student
	submitting the work."
	</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Examples of Academic Dishonesty include but are not limited to: Plagiarism (see
definition below), giving or receiving unauthorized assistance on exams,
quizzes, class assignments or projects, unauthorized collaboration, multiple
submissions (in whole or part) of work that has been previously submitted for
credit.
</p>

<p>
Plagiarism is any attempt to represent the work or ideas of someone else as
your own.  This includes purchasing or obtaining papers from any person and
turning them in as your own.  It also includes the use of paraphrases or quotes
from a published source without properly citing the source.  All written
assignments may be submitted for textual similarity review to
<a href="http://turnitin.com/">Turnitin.com</a> for the detection of plagiarism.
</p>

<p>
For assignments, access to notes, textbook, books and other publications is
allowed. Stealing, giving or receiving any code, diagrams, drawings, text, or
designs from another person (CSU or non-CSU) is <strong>not allowed</strong>.
Having access to another person's work on the system or giving access to your
work to another person is <strong>not allowed</strong>.
It is your responsibility to keep your work confidential.
</p>

<p>
<strong>No cheating in any form will be tolerated.</strong> Please be aware
that anyone caught cheating or plagiarizing in this class will receive a “0”
for the assignment/exam and may receive a “0” for the course. A second instance
of Academic Dishonesty may result in immediate dismissal from the Computer
Science programs and expulsion from Columbus State University. See
<a href="https://cs.columbusstate.edu/resources/academic-dishonesty-policy.php">https://cs.columbusstate.edu/resources/academic-dishonesty-policy.php</a>
for more details.

<h3>ATTENDANCE POLICY</h3>
<p>
Although attendance is not required, it is <em>strongly</em> urged (provided
the course is not an on-line course) and may
be taken so as to determine your involvement in the course in order to
satisfy certain Columbus State University reporting requirements.
Be aware that I am less likely to help those who have not
availed themselves of the class time (or in the case of on-line classes, the
discussion group).  Remember, you are still responsible
for all the covered material, regardless of your attendance.
Refer to the <a href="http://academics.columbusstate.edu/catalogs/current/acaregs_undergrad.php#attendance">Attendance Policy</a>
in the CSU Catalog for more information on class attendance and withdrawal.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong> Failure to submit the signed non-repudiability
portion of this syllabus <em>or</em> to join the Yahoo discussion group for
this class (as indicated in the class notes) by <em>noon of the first Friday
after classes have started</em>, will be understood by the instructor as an
indication that the student is not interested in continuing in the class
and may result in the student being <strong>dropped from the class</strong>. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Caution:</strong> In addition to the applicable portions of any
textbook(s) for this class, lectures will likely include material not
presented in the book.  Unless otherwise noted, you are responsible to
know and understand all materials covered in class (and in the discussion
group), assigned from the text, or indicated on the course web site
regardless of your own attendance. 
</p>

<h3>ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h3>
<p>
All cell phones and pagers must be turned off prior to entering the classroom
or lab. The use of any electronic device during a test or quiz is prohibited
unless otherwise indicated by the instructor. This includes handheld
calculators, cell phones and smart phones, personal digital assistants, tablets,
laptops, and similar devices. Any unauthorized use of such a device during a
test or quiz will be considered a breach of academic integrity.
</p>

<h3>LEARNING ASSISTANCE RESOURCES</h3>
<p>
Free academic tutoring is available from the following CSU programs:
</p>

<h4>Computer Science Tutoring</h4>
<p>
Tutoring for lower-division computer science courses is available in CCT450
(MTWRF 9am-10pm). See
<a href="https://cs.columbusstate.edu/students/lab_schedule.php">https://cs.columbusstate.edu/students/lab_schedule.php</a>
for details. 
</p>

<h4>Academic Center for Tutoring (ACT)</h4>
<p>
ACT offers tutoring services to help enrolled CSU students succeed in math,
science, writing, and the humanities. Visit
<a href="https://act.columbusstate.edu/">https://act.columbusstate.edu/</a>
for more information or to make an appointment.
</p>

<h4>University Writing Center (UWC)</h4>
<p>

</p>

<h3>GRADING POLICY</h3>

<h4>GENERAL</h4>
<p>
For your own protection, all graded material returned to you should be
kept until after you have received your letter grade from the
University.  If you have any question about your final letter grade,
you <em>must</em> present the graded material in question to the professor
before any adjustment will be made.  So keep these items in a safe place!
</p>

<p>
Most students find that this course
requires a great deal of work.  For some students, studying the recommended
three (3) hours out of class for every one (1) hour in class may be sufficient,
while other students may need to spend significantly more time to master
the material.  In either case please remember that grades are
based on your ability to demonstrate your mastery of the material.  In
short, results, <strong>NOT</strong> effort, determine the grade you earn.
</p>

<h4>EXAMS</h4>
<p>
If you <strong>must</strong> miss a scheduled exam, then you will be allowed
to take a makeup exam at an alternate time (provided you have sufficient
reason for the request as determined by the Instructor).  To do this you
must notify and make prior arrangements with the Instructor as soon as you
anticipate the need.  Note, however, that the makeup exam
may differ in both scope and difficulty from the exam it replaces.
Be aware that non-emergency personal travel is insufficient reason to makeup
a missed scheduled exam.
</p>

<h4>ASSIGNMENTS</h4>
<p>
Programming assignments
will be graded not only for the extent to which the programs produce
the required results, but also for programming "style".  In particular,
the programs should be well designed and self-documented with meaningful
and informative comments and identifier names.  In additional they should
also make proper use of the ideas discussed in class.  The grading criteria
for assignments will vary somewhat between assignments, however the
following are basic guidelines which will always apply to programming
assignments:
<ol>
	<li>
	Late programs (or any other assignments) will receive a grade of 0.
	<li>
	Programs with "compilation" errors will receive a grade of 0.
	<li>
	Programs with run-time errors will receive a grade no greater than 75.
	<li>
	Programs which run "to completion" but give incorrect results will 
	receive a grade no greater than 90.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
A special word of caution about the deadlines for programming assignments:
The assignments will generally require more time for completion than you
might assume at first glance.  In fact, some assignments may seem down
right easy, but you will find it even easier to underestimate the time
required to complete them.  Since the penalty for being late is rather
severe, you should begin working on each assignment as soon as it is
distributed.  Remember to allow time for unexpected problems and
difficulties; such as minor computer (or network) downtime.
</p>

<p>
A final note regarding assignments: <strong>PLEASE</strong> compile and
run your programs immediately before submitting them.  Never make a change
to the code file(s) and turn it in without compiling and running first.
It is <em>very</em> easy to make last minute mistakes that introduce syntax
or other errors, so checking before submitting can save you an unnecessary
grade of 0.
</p>

<h2>EXPECTATIONS</h2>

<h3>CLASS CONDUCT</h3>
<p>
CSU is committed to open, frank, and insightful dialogue in all of its
courses. Diversity has many manifestations, including diversity of thought,
opinion, and values. Students are encouraged to be respectful of that
diversity and to refrain from inappropriate commentary. Should such
inappropriate comments occur, I will intervene as I monitor the dialogue
in the discussions. I will request that inappropriate content be removed
from the discussion and will recommend university disciplinary action
if deemed appropriate. Students as well as faculty should be guided by
common sense and basic etiquette. The following are good guidelines to
follow:
<ol>
	<li> Never post, transmit, promote, or distribute content that is known to be illegal.
	<li> Never post harassing, threatening, or embarrassing comments.
	<li> If you disagree with someone, respond to the subject, not the person.
	<li> Never post content that is harmful, abusive; racially, ethnically, or religiously offensive; vulgar; sexually explicit; or otherwise potentially offensive.
</ol>
</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
<ol>
<li>
I will arrive on time and be prepared to give a thoughtful and well organized
lecture.
<li>
If I must miss a class, I will arrange for a substitute to cover the scheduled
material.
<li>
Graded work will be evaluated and returned to you
in a timely fashion, usually within 3 working days.
<li>
Graded work will be evaluated in a uniform and consistent manner.
<li>
On work days, I will check my electronic mail frequently throughout
the day.
<li>
If you come to me with a question, I will ask you questions to determine
any misunderstandings you might have of the material as well as to guide you
in discovering the answer for yourself.
Do not expect me to <em>just give you</em> the answer to questions.  If I
do, you should feel cheated!
<li>
Do not expect this to be an easy course.  <em>It isn't!</em>
</ol>


<h3>STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
<ol>
<li>
You will attend virtually every scheduled class meeting.
<li>
You will arrive on time and prepared to listen attentively, taking notes
as necessary.
<li>
I expect you to have read over the appropriate materials and to have
considered questions put to you before coming to class.
<li>
Graded work should be neat and turned in on time.
<li>
All graded work should be your own, with any questions concerning such
work directed to the Professor only.
<li>
At least once every weekday, you should check your electronic mail and the
WWW pages associated with this course.
<li>
When you come to me with a question, you should have made an attempt
to find the answer on your own first.
<li>
If you have questions about the
material or are having difficulty understanding it, please come by and
ask me about it as soon as practical.  Since the material builds on itself,
later material will not make sense until you understand the previous material.
<li>
I expect you to work hard, keep up, and master the material covered during
the semester.
</ol>
