<p>
You are to write a C program (use the file name "fruity.c") that reads in a
list of fruits (fruit names are not previously known) and then prints out the
fruit name, the number of fruits, and what percentage of total fruits each
fruit makes up.
You may assume that all fruit names are no longer
than 80 characters, but your code MUST be written so as to handle an arbitrary
number of fruits (i.e., don't assume that there's a maximum number of fruits
that will be given - no matter how large).  The fruit names will be given one
per line.  A sample output might look like:
<pre>
grape    4   20.0%
banana  10   50.0%
apple    5   25.0%
peach    1    5.0%
</pre>
The format of your output should mimic the style of the above sample output as
much as possible. The fruits and their statistics can be printed in any order,
but should printed one per line.
Please note that capitalization is significant, so that "Apple" and "apple"
are <em>different</em> fruits.  In order to receive full credit, your solution
must:
<ol>
<li> use a dynamically allocated linked list that you build using "struct",
<li> declare, implement, and use at least two functions in addition to "main",
<li> at least one of these declared functions should have a formal parameter,
	and
<li> at least one of these declared functions should return a non-void type,
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Your program should take the input from standard input (e.g., keyboard and/or
shell input redirection). Likewise, output should be written to standard
output (e.g., screen) that can be redirected to a file using the shell if
desired.
</p>

<p>
You are responsible for creating your own test data. It's a good idea to
create your test cases first, building upon your test data, as this will
help you with your development. Be sure to include a variety of "corner cases"
to ensure that your program doesn't work for only "normal" data.
Test driven development (TDD) is a good practice that you should cultivate.
</p>

<p>
As always, be sure to use good indentation, descriptive constant, variable,
type, function, procedure, and class names.  Use named constants when
appropriate.  Also use good commenting style, remembering that the first
thing in any program file should be a comment that gives a brief overview
of what the file contains (and should do).  You might find these
<a href="../../common/comment-guide.shtml">commenting guidelines</a> helpful.
</p>

<p>
Finally, please only submit your source code file(s) for the assignment
(e.g., fruity.c). In particular, do <em>not</em> submit zip, jar, tar, or
other collections/archives.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Good luck!</strong>
