<li> Which strategy for dealing with deadlock is used by most systems (e.g.,
	Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Prevention
	<li> Dynamic avoidance
	<li> Detection and recovery
	<li> Ignore the problem
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Determining whether or not a deadlock <em>actually</em> exists in the
	system requires
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> building the deadlock model graph and checking for cycles.
	<li> checking whether or not <strong>all</strong> processes are in
		the blocked state.
	<li> periodically checking how long blocked processes have been blocked.
	<li> periodically checking whether there are any processes in the ready
		state.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Deadlock detection is
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> fast and easy to run, so it should be done every time a resource is
		allocated.
	<li> fast and easy to run, so it should be done every time a new process
		is created.
	<li> rather slow and costly to run, so it should be run only when a
		process has been blocked for a long time (assuming there's no
		urgent need to detect a possible deadlock).
	<li> rather slow and costly to run, so it should be run only when
		there is no user process in the ready state. That is, it
		should be run as the idle process.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> If a deadlock has been detected, recovery can be accomplished by
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> waiting until a process in the deadlock releases
		<strong>all</strong> its resources.
	<li> rolling back a process in the deadlock to a checkpoint before it
		requested a resource participating in the deadlock.
	<li> terminating a process in the deadlock (thus releasing
		<strong>all</strong> of its granted resources).
	<li> change <strong>all</strong> of the processes in the deadlock
		to the ready state.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> When recovering from a deadlock by terminating a process that was
	participating in a deadlock
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> give preference to processes with the least amount of
		accumulated CPU time is often <strong>best</strong>.
	<li> change <strong>all</strong> remaining blocked processes to the
		ready state after terminating the offending process.
	<li> recheck to determine if any additional deadlocks still exist.
	<li> do <strong>not</strong> allow any other processes in the deadlock
		to acquire the resources released by the terminating process.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
