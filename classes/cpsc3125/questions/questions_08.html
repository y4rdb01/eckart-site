<li> The index given for an array reference in C
	<ol class="answer_list">

		within its range.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> A "string" value in C is really an array of type "char". So the
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> string value needs to be null terminated.
	<li> array <strong>must</strong> be exactly as long as the desired
		string.
	<li> array should be at least one char longer than the desired string.

<li> If an array index in C is outside the bounds of the array, then
	<ol class="answer_list">

		that array location.
	<li> there is <strong>always</strong> accessible storage associated
		with that array location.
	<li> None of the above

<li> The declaration of an array (e.g., variables, function formal parameters)
	<strong>must always</strong> include the
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> starting index of the array.
	<li> size of the array.
	<li> corresponding "#define" declaration for the array size.
	<li> type of the array elements.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Arrays in C
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> grow dynamically as more items are added (similar to
		<em>ArrayList</em>s in Java).
	<li> <strong>always</strong> have an associated length that can be
		queried to determine the number of items in the array.
	<li> are polymorphic, meaning that any mix of items can be stored in
		the same array.
	<li> are really just pointers to their item type (e.g., "int x[]" and
		"int *x" are the same).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> A pointer is another name for the
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> type of values that can be assigned to a variable.
	<li> forward declaration of a function.
	<li> declaration of a "struct"ure.
	<li> address of the memory location holding a desired value.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> In C, pointers are declared
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> only for declarations of arrays.
	<li> by giving an asterisk (*) before the variable name declaration.
	<li> by giving an ampersand (&) before the variable name declaration.
	<li> for <strong>all</strong> formal parameters of functions.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> In C, if "x" and "y" are declared by "int x, *y;", then "y = &x;"
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> is undefined.
	<li> assigns "y" the value of "x".
	<li> makes "y" an alias for "x" so that any value assigned to one
		is automatically assigned to the other.
	<li> assigns "y" the memory address where the value for "x" is located.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> This array declaration in C, "char name[10];",
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> reserves 10 contiguous bytes (characters) of storage for "name".
	<li> is equivalent to the declaration "string name;".
	<li> declares "name" as a pointer to the reserved storage.
	<li> declares each element of the array "name" as a pointer to a "char".
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Which of the following declarations in C is equivalent to "char *var;"?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> char &var;
	<li> char var[10];
	<li> char var[];
	<li> char &var[];
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Strings in C are represented as an array of "char"acters
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> with the length kept separately so that the size of the string
		is known (e.g., when printing).
	<li> that are terminated by a null value to denote their end.
	<li> and can be referenced via a "char"acter pointer (e.g., "char *").
	<li> which are immutable, so that the value cannot be changed
		(only copied).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The address operator in C, ampersand (&),
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> converts a variable into a pointer, so that "&y" makes "y" a
		pointer to an "int" when "y" was declared via "int y;".
	<li> is only used when passing parameters.
	<li> returns the memory address of any expression it is applied to
		(e.g., "&(2*x + 3)").
	<li> returns the memory address of the variable it is applied to
		(e.g., "&x").
	<li> None of the above

</li><br/>
<li> In C, if the following declaration/initialization is made,
	"int *x = &y;", then "x++"
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> makes "x" point to the next address in memory (following "y")
		that can hold an "int" value.
	<li> is undefined and causes a compilation error.
	<li> is defined but causes a run-time error.
	<li> increases the value of "y" by 1.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Write a C program that takes a single command line argument and prints
	"YES" if the argument is a palindrome, and "NO" otherwise. The
	program should <strong>not</strong> declare any additional arrays
	other than the one that is a parameter to "main".
</li><br/>
<li> Write a C program that reverses the input given to it. So that the last
	character on the last line of input will be the first one printed.
	You may assume that the input is no more than 2047 characters long.
</li><br/>
<li> Write a C program that reads floats from the input, calculates and prints
	out their average, and indicates how many of the original values were
	above and how many were below the average.
	You may assume that there are no more than 2047 numbers in the input.
