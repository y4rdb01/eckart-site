<li> Which of the following prevents deadlock by negating the exclusive use
	of resources?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> The use of two-phase locking.
	<li> Use spooling and a spool daemon, with the spool daemon using only
		a single resource.
	<li> Allow a process to hold only one resource at a time.
	<li> Requiring that new resource requests by a process occur in
		increasing resource priority order.
	<li> None of the above
