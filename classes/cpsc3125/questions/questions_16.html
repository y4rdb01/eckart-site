<li> Monitors, unlike semaphores, <strong>must</strong> be implemented as
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> a (system) library so that different languages can share the
		same implementation.
	<li> part of the programming language design.
	<li> part of the OS design.
	<li> a feature within the computer hardware.
	<li> None of the above

<li> Monitors are most easily adapted to programming languages that support
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> classes (e.g., Java).
	<li> records/structures (e.g., C).
	<li> functions (e.g., C, Cobol, Fortran).
	<li> conditional looping constructs, like "while" (e.g., C, Java).

<li> What feature in Java can be used to implement a monitor?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> virtualized

	<li> finalized
	<li> synchronized
	<li> None of the above

</li><br/>
<li> A different semaphore associated with each object instance can be used
	to implement a monitor by having each
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> object do P/DOWN when it is created and a V/UP
		when it is destroyed.
	<li> object do V/UP when it is created and a P/DOWN

	<li> object method do P/DOWN when begun, and V/UP just before returning.
