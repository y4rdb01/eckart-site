<li> Multicomputers differ from multiprocessors in that they
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> use loosely coupled CPUs.
	<li> do <strong>not</strong> use a shared memory - each node has
		its own private memory.
	<li> have secondary storage (i.e., local disk) associated with each
		node.
	<li> each node has its own network interface.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The critical component in a multicomputer is
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> the shared memory used by the collection of nodes.
	<li> a hierarchy of cache memories with each higher level of cache
		being (indirectly) shared by a larger set of nodes.
	<li> each node's very fast CPU (much faster than the CPUs of a
		multiprocessor).
	<li> its interconnection network.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>

	<li> Torus
	<li> Hybercube
	<li> None of the above

	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Bus
	<li> Star
	<li> Ring
	<li> Mesh

	<li> Torus
	<li> None of the above

	<li> Torus
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> For a binary <em>tree</em> network topology, what is the maximum number of
	switches/nodes/hops that a message will need to pass through on its

	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> 1

	<li> sqrt(N)
	<li> N/2

<li> For a simple <em>mesh</em> network topology (not a torus), what is the

</li><br/>
<li> Most network interfaces have their own RAM (rather than relying on the
	node's RAM) to better support store-and-forward packet switching
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> by providing independent operation of the network interface
		in case the node suffers a catastrophic failure.
	<li> so when packets arrive out of order the local RAM is used
		to resort the messages back into the order they were sent.
	<li> to avoid delays caused by contention on the node's local system
		bus.
	<li> by enabling acknowledgement messages to be sent.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> As network interfaces become more capable (with the inclusion of CPUs),
	they can often handle tasks like
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> encryption/decryption.
	<li> data compression.
	<li> broadcast/multicast.
	<li> message receipt acknowledgement.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Internode communication in a multicomputer can be relatively slow
	(compared to the local node's system bus) due to
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> having to copy data from applications to the kernel buffer, then
		to the network interface to send a message (reversing the
		process when messages are received).
	<li> the propigation delay of electricity in metal wires (or light
		in fiber optic cables) - even when the nodes are only
		a few feet apart.
	<li> needing to receive an acknowledgement back from the receiver
		before sending the next packet (piece) of a long message.
	<li> the potential for packets to arrive out of order at their
		destination.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
