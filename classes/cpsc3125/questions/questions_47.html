<li> In the context of a computer system, the following are considered
	resources:

	<li> I/O devices
	<li> CPU
	<li> Memory
	<li> Software
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> A preemptable resource is one that when temporarily taken away from a
	process
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> will <strong>not</strong> cause a problem for the preempted
		process.
	<li> may sometimes cause a problem for the preempted process,
		including possible process failure.
	<li> <strong>always</strong> results in failure of the preempted
		process.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> A non-preemptable resource is one that when taken away (even if only
	temporarily) from a process
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> will <strong>not</strong> cause a problem for the preempted
		process.
	<li> may sometimes cause a problem for the preempted process,
		including possible process failure.
	<li> <strong>always</strong> results in failure of the preempted
		process.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The typical interaction pattern between a process and a resource is
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> detected, requested, used, released.
	<li> requested, used, released.
	<li> requested, granted, used, released.
	<li> granted, used, released.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Software (e.g., blocks of code) can be viewed as a non-premeptable resource
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> because they in turn use resources (e.g., CPU, memory).
	<li> when mutex semaphores are used to controlled access.
	<li> since it can access the system bus.
	<li> if it is part of a user process that the OS schedules to run
		in the CPU.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Which of the following conditions <strong>must</strong> hold in order for
	deadlock to exist?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Only one instance of each type of resource exists.
	<li> Mutually exclusive use of resources.
	<li> Resources are controlled and allocated only by the OS.
	<li> Processes can hold resources while requesting additional resources.
	<li> Process scheduling <strong>must</strong> be non-preemptive.
	<li> Granted resources cannot be preempted.
	<li> All resources within the system have been allocated.
	<li> Circular wait condition.
	<li> All processes within the system are in the blocked state.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> A set of processes is deadlocked when
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> <strong>all</strong> of the processes in the set are in the
		blocked state.
	<li> every resource in the system has been granted to a process in
		the set.
	<li> each process in the set is waiting for an event that only another
		process in the set can cause.
	<li> no process in the set has been granted a preemptable resource. 
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Which of the following is <strong>not</strong> a strategy for dealing
	with deadlocks?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Prevention
	<li> Dynamic avoidance
	<li> Detection and recovery
	<li> Ignore the problem
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Deadlock modeling represents resources (squares) and processes (circles)
	as a graph with
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> arrows pointing from a process to a resource represent an
		(ungranted) resource request.
	<li> arrows pointing from a resource to a process represent a
		granted resource.
	<li> arrows pointing in both directions between a process and a
		resource represent a granted dedicated non-preemptable
		resource.
	<li> undirected lines (no arrows) between a process and a resource
		represent a granted preemptable resource.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> In a deadlock model graph, a deadlock exists when
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> at least one process has more than two (2) arrows pointing to it.
	<li> at least one resource has more than two (2) arrows pointing to it.
	<li> there is a directed cycle in the graph.
	<li> the graph forms a tree.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The following resource graph indicates that:<br/>

	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> No deadlock exists.
	<li> No deadlock exists, but there is a livelock on "T".
