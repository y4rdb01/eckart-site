<li> Middleware is that software which
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> implements the abstract software layer that provides uniformity

	<li> sits between the hypervisor and the virtual machine's OS.
	<li> provides the abstract machine on which a type 1 hypervisor runs.
	<li> provides the abstract machine on which a type 2 hypervisor runs.

<li> The original implementation of the World Wide Web is an example of this
	middleware approach.

<li> Middleware that transfers data from a remote file server to the local

<li> When data is collected together into units, is stored on remote servers,

<li> Tuple spaces and publish/subscribe systems are examples of

	<li> Object-based middleware
	<li> Coordination-based middleware
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Linda tuple spaces use a share list of time ordered published data
	that is accessed via the operations
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> "in" which returns the first matching tuple, blocking until a
		matching value is found.
	<li> "read" which returns the first matching tuple, returning no
		match if no tuple is found (i.e., non-blocking).
	<li> "out" that publishes a new tuple to the shared list.
	<li> "delete" which removes the matching tuple from the shared list.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>

<li> The publish/subscribe model requires that consumers (subscribers)
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> cannot also be publishers. 
	<li> register their interest in topics (about which data may be
		published) with a centralized authority as one way to ensure
		data receipt.
	<li> directly acknowledge receipt (to the publisher) of all the data
		that they receive, regardless of whether this was a topic
		in which the subscriber was interested.
	<li> poll publishers periodically to get data that is available on
		topics that the subscriber has indicated an interest.
	<li> None of the above

<li> The publish/subscribe model requires that publishers
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> must also be subscribers themselves.
	<li> make all published data for a topic available to subscribers
		that have registered an interest in that topic.
	<li> broadcast the existence of all new published data (though not
		the actual data itself) to all
		subscribers (even if the data doesn't belong to a topic in
		which the subscriber has registered an interest)
	<li> indicate what topic published data belongs to.

<li> Which of the following are examples of object-based middleware?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).

	<li> Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA).
	<li> Representational State Transfer (REST).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) uses which of
	the following elements to enable data access?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Interface Definition Language (IDL) is used to describe the
		object access methods and parameter types.
	<li> Object Request Brokers (ORBs) which enable clients to contact
		servers (on which objects reside).
	<li> Object adapters which wrap non-CORBA objects so that they can
		be used within the CORBA framework.
	<li> Native Language Translation (NLT) which convert the programming
		language independent IDL descriptions to those of specific
		languages (e.g., Java).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The transfer models most commonly used for File-System-based middleware
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> send edit commands to the remote server so that the file
		contents never leave the server.
	<li> edit parts of the file without downloading the entire file (e.g.,
		using NFS).
	<li> download the entire file, alter it, then upload the file (e.g.,
		using ftp)
	<li> send the message digest of the file to the client, rather than
		the file itself. Edits on the message digest are then sent
		back and reverse applied to the original file on the server.

<li> The principle of <em>location transparency</em> for File-System-based
	middleware
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> automatically converts encoding systems as files are moved
		between systems (e.g., EBCIDIC vs ASCII).
	<li> uses a system independent encoding for files independent of the
		file system on which they are stored.
	<li> tags each file with its current physical location.
	<li> gives no indication of where the file is physically located.

<li> The principle of <em>location independence</em> for File-System-based
	middleware
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> uses a system independent encoding for files independent of the
		file system on which they are stored.
	<li> means that the path name of the file does not change when
		the file's physical location changes.
	<li> gives no indication of where the file is physically located.
	<li> enables files to be accessible regardless of their physical
		location.

<li> Using the original World Wide Web as an example of Document-based
	middleware
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) identifies the document to
		be retrieved.
	<li> file locations are indicated separately from the URL.
	<li> only entire documents are delivered.

</li><br/>
<li> Sequential consistency for File-System-based middleware
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> requires that files be locked by a single process thread when
		they are being edited, so that simultaneous changes are
		<strong>not</strong> possible.
	<li> ensures that actions on shared resources appear as if they are
		performed in order (even if they aren't).
	<li> enforces sequential access for a file so that changes cannot
		be made in random locations.
	<li> means that changes to an open file are initially visible only
		to the process that made the changes. Other processes see
		the changes only after the file is closed.
