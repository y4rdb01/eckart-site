<li> Which of the following is <strong>not</strong> true of a logic bomb?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> They can be set to activate at a particular time or when an event
		happens (or fails to happen).
	<li> It is immediately obvious when a logic bomb has "exploded".
	<li> Bombs can remove files or change encryption/decryption keys.
	<li> They are nearly always installed after an employee has
		left the organization (usually for revenge).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Which of the following is <strong>not</strong> true of a back door attack?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> All back door attacks provide login access to the computer system
		or network.
	<li> Are crafted to allow privileged access to data or the computer
		system.
	<li> Some degree of special privilege or access is required to install
		a back door attack.
	<li> Back doors don't necessarily guarantee access, but may offer only
		a greater chance of gaining access.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Which of the following is <strong>not</strong> true of a spoofing attack?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Spoofing attacks require some degree of privileged access to data
		or the computer system.
	<li> Are based on mimicking an existing interface in order to trick
		users into providing secret information.
	<li> Spoofing attacks are the most difficult attack to defend against.
	<li> Are a specialized form of back door attacks.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Phishing attacks are a special type of spoofing attack that
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> can have success rates as high as 70%.
	<li> depend upon specialized and confidential information in order to
		convince others to provide computer access.
	<li> leverage a back door to gain credibility, leveraging that trust
		into more elevated access.
	<li> use social engineering techniques to gain information that leads
		to computer and data access.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Defending against insider attacks
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> uses exactly the same techniques as defending against outside
		attacks.
	<li> involves separation of duties so that one person doesn't have
		too much control.
	<li> often uses code reviews so that it is harder to sneak in an
		obvious weakness/attack.
	<li> benefit from keeping personnel in the same position for
		many years to reduce social engineering opportunities.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
