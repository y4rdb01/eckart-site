<li> Which of the following are reasons why an organization might use many
	computers rather than a single large computer system (running a single
	OS)?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Different operating systems need to be used.
	<li> Prevent problems with applications from impacting other
		(otherwise unrelated) applications.
	<li> Using different computer systems for software development and
		testing.
	<li> Using a separate computer system for testing newly acquired
		(untrusted) software.
	<li> With multiple systems, having one compromised by an attacker
		does <strong>not</strong> impact applications running on
		the other (UNcompromised) systems.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Some of the problems associated with an organization having and
	maintaining a large number of separate smaller computers, as opposed
	to a single large computer, are that they are
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> upgraded incrementally, so that not all of the computers may
		be the same.
	<li> time consuming to administer.
	<li> more likely to deadlock.
	<li> wasteful of compute resources when machines are sitting idle
		(while others could be overloaded).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> A hypervisor enables a single physical computer to
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> do more computations per second than is possible without it.
	<li> appear as if it is many computers.
	<li> run serveral different operating systems at the same time.
	<li> use less electricity.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Advantages of running multiple virtual machines on a hypervisor over

	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> using less electricity.
	<li> generating less heat.
	<li> taking up less space.
	<li> requiring less effort to administer.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Advantages of running multiple virtual machines on a hypervisor over
	separate physical computers include 
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> reducing the overall system cost since some elements of the
		separate computer systems will not be fully replicated.
	<li> easy migration of an application from one hypervisor to another.
	<li> reducing the wasted CPU cycles of unbalanced utilization
	<li> the ability to run legacy software that requires older versions
		of the OS not available on the newer hardware.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The disadvantages of running virtual machines (within a hypervisor)
	on a single physical machine (over using separate physical
	machines) include
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> having to run the same OS on each virtual machine (VM).
	<li> a reduced ability to survive failures (e.g., a single power
		supply failure now impacts many operating systems and their
		applications).
	<li> requiring all the VMs to use the same file system.
	<li> a larger degree of wasted CPU resources when all of the VMs
		are idle.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>

	<li> 1999.
	<li> 2005.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> When a hypervisor is able to provide virtual machines that are
	indistinguishable from the underlying hardware, this is called
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> pseudo virtualization.
	<li> quasi virtualization.
	<li> paravirtualization.
	<li> full virtualization.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> When a hypervisor requires that the OS running on a virtual machine
	use hypercalls to access certain capabilities, this is called 
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> pseudo virtualization.
	<li> quasi virtualization.
	<li> paravirtualization.
	<li> full virtualization.
	<li> None of the above

</li><br/>
<li> The computer architecture hardware requirements for virtualization
	include
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> safety.
	<li> reliability.
	<li> orthoganality.
	<li> fidelity.
	<li> efficiency.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> To ensure that all virtualized resources are fully controlled by the
	hypervisor, it is
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> necessary that <strong>all</strong> instructions issued
		to the VM be interpreted.
	<li> possible that some (but likely not all) machine instructions
		can be executed directly (without interpretation).
	<li> <strong>never</strong> necessary to use interpretation -
		<strong>all</strong> instructions can be directly executed
		on the hardware.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Instructions that behave differently depending upon whether or not
	they are executed in kernel mode or user mode, are called

	<li> sensitive instructions.
	<li> virtual instructions.
	<li> permissive instructions.
	<li> priviledged instructions.
