<li> Barriers are useful when a number of different threads/processes need to
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> take turns working on a common task.
	<li> <strong>must all</strong> meet at a common place before
		proceeding to the next phase of a computation.
	<li> share a set of common variables/objects.
	<li> none of the threads/processes are allowed to go past a
		certain point in the computation.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> If <strong>all</strong> the threads/processes take very close to the same
	amount of time to reach the barrier, then a good way of implementing
	the barrier is
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> spin locks.
	<li> semaphores.
	<li> monitors.
	<li> message passing.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The "thread" function below is run multiple times simultaneously (each
	instance is passed a different value of "i" from 0 to N-1). The
	"barrier" function ensures that <strong>all</strong>
	the threads wait until <strong>all</strong> have
	reached this point before proceeding. Use "count", and the "down"
	and "up" operations on both the N "mutex_thread" (declared
	as an array) and "mutex_count" semaphores to implement the
	"barrier" function semantics.
