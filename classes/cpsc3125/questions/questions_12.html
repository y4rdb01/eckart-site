<li> The key issues for interprocess communication are
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> message passing.
	<li> sharing information.
	<li> semaphores.
	<li> sequencing process interactions.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> A race condition exists when
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> two or more processes share the same variable.
	<li> only user space threads are used for multiprogramming.
	<li> only kernel space threads are used for multiprogramming.
	<li> different execution orderings of instructions in multiple
		threads/processes can produce different results.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Race conditions can occur when
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> two or more threads/processes can read (but <strong>not</strong>
		change) the same variable(s).
	<li> two or more threads/processes can read and write the same
		variable(s) via UNinterruptible actions.
	<li> two or more threads/processes can read and write the same
		variable(s) via interruptible actions.
	<li> when there is a mix of user space and kernel space threads
		within the same process, but no shared variable(s).
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> A critical section is a portion of executable code
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> that makes system calls.
	<li> in which only one thread (or process) should be active at a time.
	<li> that is protected by one or more semaphores.
	<li> which is shared by multiple threads.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Critical sections should be as small as possible because
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> larger critical sections run more slowly.
	<li> this reduces the amount of process blocking.
	<li> there is a maximum code size for which semaphores will work.
	<li> they <strong>must</strong> run completely through
		<strong>without</strong> blocking.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Which of the following help to prevent difficulties when simultaneous
	threads/processes share data?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> No 2 threads/processes are in their critical sections at the
		same time.
	<li> No assumptions are made about process execution speeds.
	<li> No thread/process should wait arbitrarily long to enter its
		critical section.
	<li> No thread/process outside its critical section should block other
		threads/processes.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
