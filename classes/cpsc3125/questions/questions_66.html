	<li> packets can be rerouted around network congestion.
	<li> there is lower communication latency than a circuit based network
		(e.g., Plain Old Telephone Service - POTS).

		a circuit based network.

<li> The Ethernet protocols rely on the ability
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> to detect when two or more computers are trying to use the same
		network segment at the same time (i.e., collision detection).
	<li> for a computer to lock the network segment it wants to communicate
		on so that no other computer can use it, thus avoiding
		communication collisions.
	<li> that if a communication collision is sensed, to wait increasingly
		longer periods of time before retrying.
	<li> to create a circuit between two computers to ensure fast and

<li> <em>Binary exponential backoff</em> is a strategy used when two
	(or more) computers are trying to share the same resource
	(e.g., a network) at the same time in which
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> the computer with the lower Internet Protocol (IP) address is
		given priority and the one with the larger IP address waits
		until no computer with a lower IP address is trying to use
		the resource.
	<li> the computer with the higher total number of processes is
		given priority and the one with the lower number of processes
		waits until no computer with a higher number of processes is
		trying to use the resource.
	<li> the computers stop trying to use the resource, wait a random
		period of time (between 0 and T microseconds), then retry
		using the resource. If there's still a collision, the
		computers double the wait time (2 to 2T microseconds) before
		trying again, repeating until a maximum wait time is
		reached.
