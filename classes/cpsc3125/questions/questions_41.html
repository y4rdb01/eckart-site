<li> Which of the following are part of the 4 layers of I/O software?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Device controller firmware
	<li> Interrupt handlers
	<li> Device drivers
	<li> User level I/O software
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> An easy and efficient way to deal with I/O interrupts from devices is to
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> <strong>always</strong> use Direct Memory Access (DMA) for I/O
		so that interrupts aren't generated.
	<li> have the device driver block when I/O is initiated, so the
		interrupt handler simply unblocks the driver when the interrupt
		is received.
	<li> let the device driver run as part of the OS so that a full
		context switch isn't necessary when an interrupt unblocks a
		device driver.
	<li> combine the interrupt handler and device driver into a single
		user level system call so that <strong>all</strong> parts of
		the I/O software stack are run as a single unit.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Device driver code, particularly in the consumer market, is most commonly
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> installed on the device controller.
	<li> compiled into the OS.
	<li> dynamically loaded into the OS.
	<li> no longer needed as all device manufacturers are moving to a
		single standard API.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> The device dependent code for performing I/O resides in which I/O software
	layer(s)?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Device controller firmware
	<li> Interrupt handlers
	<li> Device drivers
	<li> User level I/O software
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Devices drivers are
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> normally provided by the device manufacturer, but usually only
		for the most popular OSs.
	<li> <strong>always</strong> written to block during an I/O operation.
	<li> often run as part of the OS kernel, to avoid the overhead of a
		full context switch.
	<li> coded using static variables to reduce the size of the run-time
		stack, since the device driver only services one request at
		a time.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Which of the following help make I/O software independent of the specific
	device being used?
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Using file names as the names for devices.
	<li> Controlling access to devices through file ownership and access
		permissions.
	<li> Adherence to a common and uniform Application Programming
		Interface (API).
	<li> Enable user programs, via system calls, to access specialized
		features of devices via manufacturer specific control codes.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Device independent capabilities generally include mechanisms to control:
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> interrupt delay and timeouts.
	<li> buffering.
	<li> error reporting.
	<li> device acquisition and release.
	<li> the device data block size.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> Spooling (simultaneous peripheral operations on-line) is a technique that
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> uses buffering to prevent slow devices (e.g., printers) from
		making the CPU busy wait.
	<li> allows non-shareable devices to be used serial, but appear to
		user software as if they are being shared.
	<li> is only used in conjunction with printing devices.
	<li> uses a single program to operate a non-shareable device.
	<li> None of the above
	</ol>
</li><br/>
<li> System calls (e.g., read, write) and library routines (e.g., fprintf)
	are provided by which I/O software layer.
	<ol class="answer_list">
	<li> Device controller firmware
	<li> Interrupt handlers
	<li> Device drivers
	<li> User level I/O software
	<li> None of the above
