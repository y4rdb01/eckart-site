"You cannot do it," explained the Master, "because you do not breathe right.
Press your breath down gently after breathing in, so that the abdominal wall
is tightly stretched, and hold it there for a while.  Then breathe out as
slowly and evenly as possible, and, after a short pause, draw a quick breath
of air again -- out and in continually, in a rhythm that will gradually settle
itself.  If it is done properly, you will feel the shooting becoming easier
every day.  For through this breathing you will not only discover the source
of all spiritual strength but will also cause this source to flow more
abundantly, and to pour more easily through your limbs the move relaxed you
are."

The Master attached so much importance to breathing out as slowly and steadily
as possible to the very end, that, for better practice and control, he made us
combine it with a humming note.  Only when the note had died away with the last
expiring breath were we allowed to draw air again.  The breathing in, the
Master had once said, binds and combines; by holding your breath you make
everything go right; and the breathing out loosens and completes by overcoming
all limitations.

When, to excuse myself, I once remarked that I was conscientiously making an
effort to keep relaxed, he replied: "That's just the trouble, you make an
effort to think about it.  Concentrate entirely on your breathing, as if you
had nothing else to do!"
