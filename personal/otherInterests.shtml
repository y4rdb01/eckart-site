<p>
I received my helicopter rating (PP-RH) in 1990.  All of my 100+ hours, so far
at least, have been in the Robinson R22.  I like the R22, but wish I could
fly more often.  Having a family cuts not only into the amount of spare time
that I have, but also into my spare cash as well....sigh.  I've flown 
sailplanes a bit, and soloed several times.  While I do have a PP-RH rating
(Private Pilot Rotorcraft Helicopter) I never did get a glider rating.
While my one and only
<a href="http://www.aircraftone.com/aircraft/accidents/20001214X36356.asp">aviation accident</a>
was in the glider, I did go up
several times afterwards because I didn't want to end on a bad experience
(I was still a PhD student and money was running low).  Although I enjoyed the
<a href="http://www.ssa.org/">soaring</a>, my feelings about flight are
probably best summed up by:
<em>If you can't hover, you aren't really flying.</em>
</p>

<p>
I also hold a General Class Amateur Radio License (KA4EVL). I started
practicing morse code in about the 7th grade but dragged my feet and didn't
get my Novice Class until about the 10th grade. Then, during my
first year at college I finally passed my 13 words/minute code test (along
with the written theory test) and got my General Class. I haven't operated
for years, but hope one day to start operating again with a CW/QRP rig.

Though there wasn't a chess club, I played a bit of chess in junior high
and high school.  Reading <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?WRD=chess+fischer&z=y&cds2Pid=9481">Bobby Fischer
Teaches Chess</a> was one of my first real exposures to tactics and
was a great introductory book, without all of that daunting notation stuff.
After graduating from high school I played only
occasionally, that is until 20 years later when one of my sons,
Keith, began playing chess when he was about nine years old.
</p>

<p>
About a year after Keith started playing chess, we learned about
the nearly monthly scholastic chess tournaments that were held close by in
Roanoke, VA.  The tournaments were on Saturday's and lasted from 10am to
about 5pm.  After one day of hanging around all day waiting for him to finish
his games, I noticed that the open section allowed adult non-students to play.
I joined the <a href="http://uschess.org/">US Chess
Federation</a> and signed up for the next month's tournament.  Keith and I
began studying together from books which we continued until moving to
Columbus, GA (and then the lack of time got the better of me).
Both Keith and I have really enjoyed Yasser Seirawan's style of presentation,
which makes it easy and fun to learn, so I would highly recommend these books:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857443861/qid=1148761811/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-4884926-7285462?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Winning Chess Tactics</a>,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857443322/ref=pd_bxgy_img_b/103-4884926-7285462?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Winning Chess Strategies</a>,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857443497/qid=1148762048/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/103-4884926-7285462?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Winning Chess Openings</a>, and
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857443489/ref=pd_bxgy_img_b/103-4884926-7285462?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Winning Chess Endings</a>.
I would also highly recommend joining the
<a href="http://www.chessgames.com">Chess Games</a> site.  Their
<a href="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/explorer">Opening
Explorer</a> is an online collection of
games, including graphical browsing and win/loss/draw
statistics, that provides a wonderful way to investigate potential opening
scenarios.
