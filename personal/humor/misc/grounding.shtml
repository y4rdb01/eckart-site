[Original author unknown]

<p>
My girlfriend always seemed to enjoy seeing just how much she could get away 
with doing some form of our bondage in public.  She does this partly because 
she finds it fun, mostly because she knows it drives me out of my tree.  
Usually, I'm able to fast-talk my way out of potentially embarrassing 
situations with Mundanes, but yesterday she very nearly got me fired.
</p>

<p> 
Yesterday afternoon we had lunch together.  Afterward, she accompanied me back 
to my place of work.  I thought this slightly unusual, since she had never 
before expressed an interest in my work (electronic engineering,) but it 
didn't occur to me that she had something planned.
</p>

<p> 
We arrived at my workbench, where I'm currently trying to figure out why the 
$&%@*! board on which I'm working is not performing the way I designed it.
</p>

<p>
"Is this where you work?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"At the moment," I replied.
</p>

<p> 
I reached over to turn on the scope, thereby completely failing to notice the 
huge studded black leather collar she produced from her purse.  Before I could 
even blink (it's amazing the speed at which she can do this), she had locked 
the collar snugly around my neck, and locked the end of the six-foot jack
chain to the center of the bench (where there just happened to be a mounting 
hole, dammit).  I turned to face her in utter disbe- lief, mouth agape.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be back for you at five," she said.
</p>

<p>
"HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETELY WACKO!!?!?" I yelled in a hushed voice.  "HOW THE 
HELL AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS???" 
</p>

<p>
"You'll think of something," she said, dropping the keys into her cleavage.  
"You always do."
</p>

<p>
"But suppose I have to go to the bathroom," I countered.
</p>

<p>
"Don't give me that," she said.  "I've seen you go for a whole day without 
visiting the bathroom."
</p>

<p>
"But..." I tried to say.
</p>

<p>
"SHHH!  The subject is closed.  I'll be back at five.  Bye."
</p>

<p> 
She turned and left, against my hushed protests.  I sat in panic and tried to 
think out my situation.  I tried to think of all the people who might visit.  
Most of my co-workers were friends who knew that my girlfriend and I were a 
bit odd, so this shouldn't surprise them.  But I had *no* idea what I was 
going to say if one of my bosses came in.  I checked my watch to see how long 
I would have to endure this ignominy.  13:30 (I'm a military time weenie).  
"Three and a half hours," I thought.  I heaved a sigh, and got to work, such 
as I could.
</p>

<p> 
As it happened, three of my co-workers visited for what-not.  All of them 
immediately noticed the collar (it would be pretty hard not to), and asked if 
it was my girlfriend's idea.  I said yes.  They asked what I would say if my 
supervisor saw it.  I said I hadn't the faintest idea.
</p>

<p> 
One of the aforementioned colleagues took the bench next to me, and after a 
few remarks (and a question as to where he could get a collar like the one I 
had), settled down to work in silence.
</p>

<p> 
After some time, I checked my watch.  16:40.  "Gee, I just might make it 
through this after all," I thought.  I was even beginning to get a handle on 
the problem with the #%^*@! board on which I was working.  Murphy must have 
been standing right behind me reading my thoughts, for not more than two
minutes later one of my bosses entered the room.  And not just any boss.  
Noooooooo.  This was Mr. Narrowminded himself.  This was the guy who took 
Lifespring *and* became a born-again fundamentalist.  How he came to have the 
power of hire-and-fire over us is one of the Great Mysteries of The Universe.  
We avoided this guy at all costs.
</p>

<p> 
His eyes fell upon me immediately.  A few picoseconds later, he saw the collar 
around my neck in all its splendor.  "My life is over," I thought.  I still 
hadn't thought of a plausible explanation for this.  Mr. Solderbrain (the name 
we called him behind his back; a corruption of his real name) started to walk
slowly and deliberately over to me, his eyes fixed on the collar.  Fifteen 
agonizing seconds later, he was standing next to me.  I thought the guy sitting
next to me was going to have a seizure stifling all his giggles.  I continued 
to work, acting as though there were nothing the least bit unusual about my 
predicament.
</p>

<p> 
Finally, he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"What.  The.  HELL!  Is.  That??!" he said.
</p>

<p> 
I don't know how I thought of what I said.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I didn't 
know what I was going to say until just as I was saying it.  I'm even more 
amazed that Solderbrain actually bought it and didn't fire me on the spot.
</p>

<p> 
I turned to face him calmly, with total nonchalance, exuding complete 
confidence in what I was about to say, even though I didn't know what it was 
yet.  I didn't even miss a beat.  "Grounding strap," I said, and returned to 
work.
</p>

<p> 
The guy next to me fell off his chair and nearly died laughing.
</p>
