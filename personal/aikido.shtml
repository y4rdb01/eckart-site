Aikido is the first and only martial art I have studied. 
I remembered reading as a kid about an art that was smooth,
flowing, and that wasn't about hurting the attacker.  I don't know if what
I had read about was Aikido, but that's what prompted me to begin it's study.

My first dojo was the
<a href="http://www.aikidoatlanta.com/">Aikido Center of
Atlanta</a> under Rodney Grantham Sensei.  I studied regularly from about
1983 to 1987, attending 4-5 days a week.  However, upon getting my PhD
and moving away I let my practice lapse.  It wasn't until my oldest son, Mike,
began taking Aiki Jitsu that I began thinking about picking up Aikido again.
I found a
<a href="http://www.kodokan-aikido-blacksburg.net/">Kodokan Aikido</a>
dojo at <a href="http://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a> which was
very close by.  I practiced regularly for four years and enjoyed the dojo
immensely.  Truman Capone Sensei was a wonderful teacher and was a tremendous
help in getting me back onto "the path".  As a result, I was able to rise to
1st Kyu before moving away.  When I took the job in Columbus, I
was a little apprehensive about being able to continue my Aikido since the
closest dojo is about 40 miles away (and is in a different time zone as well).
However, I've been extremely fortunate to have found such a wonderful group
in the <a href="../aikido/index.shtml">Aikido of East Alabama</a>.
I'm particularly impressed with the ASU style of practice (and with both
George Reynolds Sensei and Jim Novak Sensei).  While ASU represents a
substantial
change from how I understood Aikido before, to me it corresponds more
directly to what I had thought Aikido to be so many years ago.
