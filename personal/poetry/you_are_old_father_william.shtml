<strong>You Are Old, Father William</strong><br/>
<br/>
"You are old, father William," the young man said,<br/>
"And your hair has become very white;<br/>
And yet you incessantly stand on your head--<br/>
Do you think, at your age, it is right?"<br/>
<br/>
"In my youth," father William replied to his son,<br/>
"I feared it might injure the brain;<br/>
But, now that I'&apos;m perfectly sure I have none,<br/>
Why, I do it again and again."<br/>
<br/>
"You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,<br/>
And you have grown most uncommonly fat;<br/>
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--<br/>
Pray what is the reason for that?"<br/>
<br/>
"In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,<br/>
"I kept all my limbs very supple<br/>
By the use of this ointment - one shilling a box--<br/>
Allow me to sell you a couple?"<br/>
<br/>
"You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak<br/>
For anything tougher than suet;<br/>
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--<br/>
Pray, how did you manage to do it?"<br/>
<br/>
"In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,<br/>
And argued each case with my wife;<br/>
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,<br/>
Has lasted the rest of my life."<br/>
<br/>
"You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose<br/>
That your eye was as steady as ever;<br/>
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--<br/>
What made you so awfully clever?"<br/>
<br/>
"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"<br/>
Said his father. "Don'&apos;t give yourself airs!<br/>
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?<br/>
Be off, or I'&apos;ll kick you down stairs.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson)</em>
