<strong>The Tale of Custard the Dragon</strong><br/>
<br/>
Belinda lived in a little white house,<br/>
With a little black kitten and a little gray mouse,<br/>
And a little yellow dog and a little red wagon,<br/>
And a realio, trulio, little pet dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Now the name of the little black kitten was Ink,<br/>
And the little gray mouse, she called her Blink,<br/>
And the little yellow dog was sharp as Mustard,<br/>
But the dragon was a coward, and she called him Custard.<br/>
<br/>
Custard the dragon had big sharp teeth,<br/>
And spikes on top of him and scales underneath,<br/>
Mouth like a fireplace, chimney for a nose,<br/>
And realio, trulio, daggers on his toes.<br/>
<br/>
Belinda was as brave as a barrel full of bears,<br/>
And Ink and Blink chased lions down the stairs,<br/>
Mustard was as brave as a tiger in a rage,<br/>
But Custard cried for a nice safe cage.<br/>
<br/>
Belinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful,<br/>
Ink, Blink and Mustard, they rudely called him Percival,<br/>
They all sat laughing in the little red wagon<br/>
At the realio, trulio, cowardly dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Belinda giggled till she shook the house,<br/>
And Blink said Week!, which is giggling for a mouse,<br/>
Ink and Mustard rudely asked his age,<br/>
When Custard cried for a nice safe cage.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, suddenly they heard a nasty sound,<br/>
And Mustard growled, and they all looked around.<br/>
Meowch! cried Ink, and Ooh! cried Belinda,<br/>
For there was a pirate, climbing in the winda.<br/>
<br/>
Pistol in his left hand, pistol in his right,<br/>
And he held in his teeth a cutlass bright,<br/>
His beard was black, one leg was wood;<br/>
It was clear that the pirate meant no good.<br/>
<br/>
Belinda paled, and she cried, Help! Help!<br/>
But Mustard fled with a terrified yelp,<br/>
Ink trickled down to the bottom of the household,<br/>
And little mouse Blink strategically mouseholed.<br/>
<br/>
But up jumped Custard, snorting like an engine,<br/>
Clashed his tail like irons in a dungeon,<br/>
With a clatter and a clank and a jangling squirm<br/>
He went at the pirate like a robin at a worm.<br/>
<br/>
The pirate gaped at Belinda'&apos;s dragon,<br/>
And gulped some grog from his pocket flagon,<br/>
He fired two bullets but they didn'&apos;t hit,<br/>
And Custard gobbled him, every bit.<br/>
<br/>
Belinda embraced him, Mustard licked him,<br/>
No one mourned for his pirate victim<br/>
Ink and Blink in glee did gyrate<br/>
Around the dragon that ate the pyrate.<br/>
<br/>
Belinda still lives in her little white house,<br/>
With her little black kitten and her little gray mouse,<br/>
And her little yellow dog and her little red wagon,<br/>
And her realio, trulio, little pet dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Belinda is as brave as a barrel full of bears,<br/>
And Ink and Blink chase lions down the stairs,<br/>
Mustard is as brave as a tiger in a rage,<br/>
But Custard keeps crying for a nice safe cage.<br/>
