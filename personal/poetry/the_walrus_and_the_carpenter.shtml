<strong>The Walrus and The Carpenter</strong><br/>
The sun was shining on the sea,<br/>
Shining with all his might:<br/>
He did his very best to make<br/>
The billows smooth and bright--<br/>
And this was odd, because it was<br/>
The middle of the night.<br/>
<br/>
The moon was shining sulkily,<br/>
Because she thought the sun<br/>
Had got no business to be there<br/>
After the day was done--<br/>
"It'&apos;s very rude of him," she said,<br/>
"To come and spoil the fun!"<br/>
<br/>
The sea was wet as wet could be,<br/>
The sands were dry as dry.<br/>
You could not see a cloud, because<br/>
No cloud was in the sky:<br/>
No birds were flying overhead--<br/>
There were no birds to fly.<br/>
<br/>
The Walrus and the Carpenter<br/>
Were walking close at hand;<br/>
They wept like anything to see<br/>
Such quantities of sand:<br/>
"If this were only cleared away,"<br/>
They said, "it would be grand!"<br/>
<br/>
"If seven maids with seven mops<br/>
Swept it for half a year.<br/>
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,<br/>
"That they could get it clear?"<br/>
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,<br/>
And shed a bitter tear.<br/>
<br/>
"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"<br/>
The Walrus did beseech.<br/>
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br/>
Along the briny beach:<br/>
We cannot do with more than four,<br/>
To give a hand to each."<br/>
<br/>
The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br/>
But never a word he said:<br/>
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br/>
And shook his heavy head--<br/>
Meaning to say he did not choose<br/>
To leave the oyster-bed.<br/>
<br/>
But four young Oysters hurried up,<br/>
All eager for the treat:<br/>
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br/>
Their shoes were clean and neat--<br/>
And this was odd, because, you know,<br/>
They hadn'&apos;t any feet.<br/>
<br/>
Four other Oysters followed them,<br/>
And yet another four;<br/>
And thick and fast they came at last,<br/>
And more, and more, and more--<br/>
All hopping through the frothy waves,<br/>
And scrambling to the shore.<br/>
<br/>
The Walrus and the Carpenter<br/>
Walked on a mile or so,<br/>
And then they rested on a rock<br/>
Conveniently low:<br/>
And all the little Oysters stood<br/>
And waited in a row.<br/>
<br/>
"The time has come," the Walrus said,<br/>
"To talk of many things:<br/>
Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--<br/>
Of cabbages--and kings--<br/>
And why the sea is boiling hot--<br/>
And whether pigs have wings."<br/>
<br/>
"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,<br/>
"Before we have our chat;<br/>
For some of us are out of breath,<br/>
And all of us are fat!"<br/>
"No hurry!" said the Carpenter.<br/>
They thanked him much for that.<br/>
<br/>
"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,<br/>
"Is what we chiefly need:<br/>
Pepper and vinegar besides<br/>
Are very good indeed--<br/>
Now if you'&apos;re ready, Oysters dear,<br/>
We can begin to feed."<br/>
<br/>
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,<br/>
Turning a little blue.<br/>
"After such kindness, that would be<br/>
A dismal thing to do!"<br/>
"The night is fine," the Walrus said.<br/>
"Do you admire the view?<br/>
<br/>
"It was so kind of you to come!<br/>
And you are very nice!"<br/>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br/>
"Cut us another slice:<br/>
I wish you were not quite so deaf--<br/>
I'&apos;ve had to ask you twice!"<br/>
<br/>
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,<br/>
"To play them such a trick,<br/>
After we'&apos;ve brought them out so far,<br/>
And made them trot so quick!"<br/>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br/>
"The butter'&apos;s spread too thick!"<br/>
<br/>
"I weep for you," the Walrus said:<br/>
"I deeply sympathize."<br/>
With sobs and tears he sorted out<br/>
Those of the largest size,<br/>
Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br/>
Before his streaming eyes.<br/>
<br/>
"O Oysters," said the Carpenter,<br/>
"You'&apos;ve had a pleasant run!<br/>
Shall we be trotting home again?'&apos;<br/>
But answer came there none--<br/>
And this was scarcely odd, because<br/>
They'&apos;d eaten every one.<br/>
