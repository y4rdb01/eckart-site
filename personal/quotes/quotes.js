quotes[0]='"Back in 2000, a Republican friend of mine warned me that if I voted for Al Gore and he won, the stock market would tank, we\'d lose millions of jobs, and our military would be totally overstretched. You know what? I did vote for Al Gore, he did win, and I\'ll be damned if all those things didn\'t come true."<p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Carville">James Carville</a></p>'

quotes[3]='If asked whether I believe in God, I suppose I must reply that as soon as incontrovertible evidence for God\'s existence is presented to me, I will accept it.<p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a></p>'

quotes[4]='That Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labor of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man\'s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins -- all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand.  Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul\'s habitation henceforth be safely built.<p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russell</a></p>'

quotes[5]='Better, faster, cheaper:  choose any two.'

quotes[6]='I am convinced that the truest act of courage is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally nonviolent struggle for justice.  To be a man is to suffer for others.<p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Chavez">Cesar Chavez</a></p>'

quotes[7]='"Fishermen sometimes amuse themselves by spearing mantas and letting the terrified beasts tow their boats - often for miles - before they are exhausted. Why quite decent men will perpetrate on sea creatures atrocities which they would instantly condemn if inflicted upon land animals (has anyone ever harpooned a horse to make it tow his car?) is a question not hard to answer. Fish live in an alien element, and many of them have outlandish shapes; therefore we feel none of the sympathy , none of the kinship, for them which often links us to the creatures of the land. Few of us ever overcome the reaction that classes anything strange as automatically dangerous.  Let us hope that we will not always retain this primitive behaviour, and will ultimately learn to base our judgments on something more than mere appearance. For one day, when the frontiers of space are down, we may meet creatures who are much more hideous than the manta - and much more intelligent than Man."<p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke">Arthur C.

quotes[11]='Just as eating against one\'s will is injurious to health, so study without liking for it spoils the memory, and it retains nothing it takes in.<p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Da_Vinci">Leonardo Da Vinci</a></p>'

quotes[13]='If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to get the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude.  See in college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the natural method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that you shall learn what you have no taste or capacity for.  The college, which should be a place of delightful labor, is made odious and unhealthy, and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jaded spirits.  I would have the studies elective.  Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge.  The wise instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for himself.  The marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor.<p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a></p>'

quotes[14]='IT IS, IN FACT, NOTHING short of a miracle that the modern methods of education have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wrack and ruin without fail. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty. To the contrary, I believe that it would be possible to rob even a healthy beast of prey of its voraciousness, if it were possible, with the aid of a whip, to force the beast to devour continuously, even when not hungry, especially if the food, handed out under such coercion, were to be selected accordingly.<p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a></p>'

quotes[26]='<h3>Why Helicopter Pilots ARE Different!</h3><p> The thing is, helicopters are different from planes.  An airplane by it\'s nature wants to fly, and if not interfered with too strongly by unusual events or by a deliberately incompentent pilot, it will fly.  A helicopter does not want to fly.  It is maintained in the air by a variety of forces and controls working in opposition to each other, and if there is any disturbance in this delicate balance the helicopter stops flying, immediately and disastrously.  There is no such thing as a gliding helicopter.</p><p> This is why being a helicopter pilot is so different from being an airplane pilot, and why in generality, airplane pilots are open, clear-eyed, buoyant, extroverts and helicopter pilots are brooding introspective anticipators of trouble.  They know if something bad has not happened it is about to.</p><p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Reasoner">Harry Reasoner</a>, February 16, 1971</p>'

quotes[29]='The lawn holds great appeal, especially to Americans.  It looks sort of natural -- it\'s green; it grows -- but in fact it represents a subjugation of the forest as utter and complete as a parking lot.  Every species is forcibly excluded from the landscape but one, and this one is forbidden to grow longer than the owner\'s little finger.

Every man knows he must love his enemies, and sell all he has and give to the poor, but he doesn\'t wish to know it - so he asks questions.<p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Horace_Blyth">R.

quotes[101]='If one\'s life is simple, contentment has to come.  Simplicity is extremely important for hapiness.

quotes[326]='How to compose a successful critical commentary:<ol><li>You should attempt to re-express your target\'s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, "Thanks, I wish I\'d thought of putting it that way."<li>You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).<li>You should mention anything you have learned from your target.<li>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.</ol><p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett">Daniel Dennett</a></p>'

quotes[327]='Like all tools, the <em>baloney detection kit</em> can be misused, applied out of context, or even employed as a rote alternative to thinking. But applied judiciously, it can make all the difference in the world — not least in evaluating our own arguments before we present them to others.<ol><li>Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the "facts."<li>Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view.<li>Arguments from authority carry little weight — "authorities" have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.<li>Spin more than one hypothesis. If there’s something to be explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might systematically disprove each of the alternatives. What survives, the hypothesis that resists disproof in this Darwinian selection among "multiple working hypotheses," has a much better chance of being the right answer than if you had simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.<li>Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it\'s yours. It\'s only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask yourself why you like the idea. Compare it fairly with the alternatives. See if you can find reasons for rejecting it. If you don\'t, others will.<li>Quantify. If whatever it is you\'re explaining has some measure, some numerical quantity attached to it, you\'ll be much better able to discriminate among competing hypotheses. What is vague and qualitative is open to many explanations. Of course there are truths to be sought in the many qualitative issues we are obliged to confront, but finding them is more challenging.<li>If there\'s a chain of argument, every link in the chain must work (including the premise) — not just most of them.<li>Occam\'s Razor. This convenient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypotheses that explain the data equally well to choose the simpler.<li>Always ask whether the hypothesis can be, at least in principle, falsified. Propositions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much. Consider the grand idea that our Universe and everything in it is just an elementary particle — an electron, say — in a much bigger Cosmos. But if we can never acquire information from outside our Universe, is not the idea incapable of disproof? You must be able to check assertions out. Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and see if they get the same result.</ol><p style="text-align:right;font-style:normal"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a></p>'
